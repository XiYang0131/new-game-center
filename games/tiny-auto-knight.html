                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Tiny Auto Knight features automatic combat, so your character will attack enemies without direct input. Your role is to make strategic decisions between battles that determine your hero's strength and abilities. After each battle, you'll earn gold and experience points. Use gold to purchase new equipment from merchants or upgrade your existing gear. When you level up, you'll be able to allocate skill points to enhance your character's abilities. Choose between different paths on the map to encounter various challenges - some paths may lead to treasure chests, others to shops, and some to particularly difficult enemies with greater rewards. When selecting equipment, pay attention to the stats and special effects. Some items may provide synergies with your character class or other equipment pieces. If your health reaches zero, your run ends, but you'll retain some resources that can be used for permanent upgrades, making future attempts easier. Experiment with different builds and strategies - a combination that works well against one type of enemy might struggle against others. Learn enemy patterns and weaknesses to better prepare for encounters. Remember that sometimes retreating from a difficult battle to find better equipment is the wisest choice.</p>

                            <p>This game is surprisingly deep for its simple appearance! I've put in about 20 hours so far and I'm still discovering new item combinations and strategies. The Ranger class is my favorite - focusing on critical hit chance and attack speed creates some insane damage output in the late game. The permanent progression system strikes a perfect balance where runs get easier over time but still remain challenging enough to be engaging. The boss on level 30 was a real wall until I figured out that fire resistance is crucial for that fight. If you're struggling with the early game, I recommend prioritizing health upgrades first before damage - surviving longer means more gold and XP per run.</p>

                            <p>I love how this game respects my time! The auto-battle system means I can play it even when I only have a few minutes to spare, but there's enough strategy in the equipment and skill choices to keep it interesting. The pixel art style is charming and the sound effects are satisfying. I've been playing it during my commute and it's perfect for that kind of short session gameplay. My only suggestion would be to add a bit more variety to the environments - after a while, the backgrounds start to look similar. Otherwise, it's a fantastic little game that packs a lot of content into a small package.</p>

                            <p>As someone who loves both roguelikes and idle games, Tiny Auto Knight hits a sweet spot between the two genres. The decision-making between battles feels meaningful, and there's a real sense of progression as you unlock new equipment and abilities. I've found that the Mage class has the highest potential damage output, but requires more specific item synergies to really shine - the Warrior is more forgiving for beginners. Pro tip: the "Vampiric" prefix on weapons is incredibly powerful since it gives you sustain during longer fights. Also, don't ignore the importance of armor penetration against later enemies with high defense values. I've managed to reach level 50 so far, and the difficulty scaling feels just right - challenging but not impossible with the right build.</p>
