                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Super Slime MQF features simple controls that are easy to learn but require practice to master. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move your slime character: Left Arrow/A moves left, Right Arrow/D moves right, and Up Arrow/W or Spacebar makes your slime jump. The unique aspect of controlling your slime is its physics-based movement - it bounces and slides realistically, requiring you to anticipate momentum and plan your jumps carefully. The higher you fall from, the higher your slime will bounce, which can be used strategically to reach elevated platforms. In each level, your primary goal is to reach the portal at the end, but you'll also want to collect as many gems as possible along the way. These gems contribute to your overall score and can unlock special features or levels. Some levels contain hidden areas with bonus gems or secret shortcuts - look for suspicious walls or platforms that might conceal these secrets. Throughout your journey, you'll encounter various obstacles and enemies. Some obstacles can be jumped over, while others must be avoided entirely. Certain enemies can be defeated by jumping on them, while others are better left alone. The game features checkpoints in longer levels, allowing you to restart from these points if you fail. Pay attention to the environment - some platforms may be slippery, fragile, or moving, each requiring different approaches. As you progress, new mechanics will be introduced, such as bounce pads, teleporters, and switches that alter the level layout. Take your time to learn each new element before tackling the more challenging sections. Remember that timing is crucial in platforming games - observe enemy patterns and moving platforms before attempting difficult jumps.</p>

                            <p>Super Slime MQF has quickly become one of my favorite platformers! The physics-based movement feels so satisfying once you get the hang of it - there's something incredibly fun about perfectly timing a bounce to reach a difficult platform. I especially love the level design in the crystal caves area (around level 15-20), where the developers really start to play with vertical space and introduce those tricky moving platforms. For anyone struggling with the ice levels, my tip is to avoid jumping unless absolutely necessary, as the momentum can easily send you sliding off platforms. The hidden areas are worth seeking out too - I found a secret room in level 23 with enough gems to unlock the bonus level! The only minor issue I've encountered is that sometimes the hitboxes on the spike obstacles feel a bit unforgiving, but it's a small complaint in an otherwise excellent game. I've completed all 30 main levels and am now working on finding all the secrets. Definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys platformers with a bit of physics puzzle elements mixed in!</p>

                            <p>This game is such a delightful surprise! The cute slime character and colorful visuals initially made me think it would be a simple, easy platformer, but there's actually a good amount of challenge here, especially in the later levels. The physics-based movement takes some getting used to - my first few attempts had me bouncing wildly out of control, but once I understood how momentum works in the game, it became much more manageable and satisfying. I particularly appreciate how the game gradually introduces new mechanics, giving you time to master each one before combining them in more complex ways. The music deserves special mention too - those catchy tunes have been stuck in my head for days! For new players, don't rush through levels trying to speedrun them right away. Take your time to understand how your slime moves and reacts to different surfaces. Also, the wall-sliding technique (jumping while against a wall) is essential for some of the trickier vertical sections. My only suggestion for improvement would be adding a level editor so players could create and share their own challenges. Overall, it's a solid 4.5/5 stars from me - Super Slime MQF proves that simple concepts executed well can create a truly engaging gaming experience!</p>
