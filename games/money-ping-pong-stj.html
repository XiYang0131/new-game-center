                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Use your mouse to control your paddle - move it around to hit the ball back to your opponent's side of the table. The left mouse button performs a normal shot, while the right mouse button executes a power shot when your power meter is charged. Move your paddle to different positions to change the angle and direction of your shots. Timing is crucial - hitting the ball at the perfect moment will result in a more powerful and accurate shot. As you win matches, you'll earn money that can be spent in the shop to upgrade your equipment. Different paddles offer various advantages such as increased power, better control, or improved spin capabilities. Practice your timing and positioning in the training mode before taking on challenging opponents in the tournament. Watch your opponent's movements carefully to anticipate their shots and develop counter-strategies. Some opponents favor power shots, while others rely on tricky spins or precise placement. Adapt your playing style accordingly to maximize your chances of winning.</p>

                            <p>I've played a lot of table tennis games, and this one stands out because of its unique money system and upgrade mechanics. The physics feel pretty realistic, and I love how different paddles actually change the gameplay rather than just being cosmetic. The "Spin Master" paddle is my favorite - once you get used to the reduced power, the spin control lets you pull off some amazing shots that opponents struggle to return. The tournament mode gets genuinely challenging in the later rounds - that final opponent is no joke! Took me several attempts to finally beat him.</p>

                            <p>This game is surprisingly addictive! I started playing just to kill some time, but the progression system keeps me coming back. I appreciate that the difficulty curve is gradual - it gives you time to learn the mechanics before throwing really tough opponents at you. The tutorial does a good job explaining the basics, but I'd recommend spending some time in practice mode to really get the hang of the timing for power shots. One tip for beginners: focus on upgrading your paddle's control stat first rather than power. It makes a huge difference in your ability to place shots accurately and return difficult serves.</p>

                            <p>The money theme in this game adds a fun twist to traditional ping pong. I like how you can earn bonus cash for performing special shots or winning without missing any returns. The different tables aren't just visual changes either - they affect how the ball bounces and moves, which adds another layer of strategy. My favorite mode is the daily challenge, where you face a random opponent with special conditions (like faster ball speed or limited visibility). The rewards are great, and it keeps the gameplay fresh. My only suggestion would be to add a multiplayer mode so I could challenge my friends. Otherwise, it's a solid sports game that's easy to pick up but takes time to master.</p>
