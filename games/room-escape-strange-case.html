                <div class="game-instructions">
                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Use your mouse to interact with the environment. Click on objects to examine them more closely or add them to your inventory. Items in your inventory can be selected and then used on other objects in the room - experiment with different combinations to solve puzzles. Pay close attention to details in the environment, as they often contain crucial clues. Look for patterns, codes, and hidden messages that might help you progress. Some puzzles may require you to manipulate objects in specific ways - drag, rotate, or combine items to discover solutions. If you get stuck, try examining everything in the room again, as you might have missed something important. The game includes a hint system that can provide guidance if you're completely stuck on a particular puzzle - click the hint button in the corner of the screen when available. Take notes on paper or mentally keep track of codes, patterns, or sequences you discover, as they might be needed later. Remember that in escape room games, everything is potentially significant - unusual markings, object placements, or color schemes could all be part of puzzles. Think logically and creatively to unravel the strange case and escape the room!</p>

                            <p>Room Escape: Strange Case is one of the most engaging escape room games I've played online! The puzzles are cleverly designed with just the right level of difficulty - challenging enough to make you think but not so obscure that they feel unfair. I particularly appreciated how the puzzles connect to each other and to the overall narrative, creating a cohesive experience rather than just a random collection of brain teasers. The atmosphere is perfectly eerie, with subtle sound effects and visual details that enhance the mysterious vibe. The desk drawer puzzle with the hidden compartment was especially satisfying to solve - I spent a good 15 minutes on that one alone! For those struggling with the bookshelf puzzle, pay close attention to the color patterns on the spines and how they might relate to other objects in the room. I managed to complete the game without using hints, which felt like a real accomplishment. The story reveal at the end was genuinely surprising and tied everything together beautifully. If you enjoy atmospheric puzzle games with a touch of mystery and horror, this one is definitely worth your time. Just make sure you have at least an hour of uninterrupted play to fully immerse yourself in the experience!</p>

                            <p>As someone who's played dozens of escape room games, I can confidently say that Strange Case stands out for its puzzle design and storytelling integration. The way the narrative unfolds through the puzzles themselves rather than through separate exposition is masterfully done. I found myself genuinely invested in discovering what happened in this room and why I was trapped there. The difficulty curve is well-balanced, starting with simpler puzzles that introduce the game's logic before ramping up to more complex challenges. The clock mechanism puzzle was particularly ingenious - it requires you to think about time in a completely different way than you might expect. One tip for new players: don't forget that you can combine items in your inventory before using them on objects in the room. This wasn't immediately obvious to me and I got stuck for a while on the chemical mixing puzzle. The attention to detail in the environment is impressive - even seemingly decorative elements often have significance if you look closely enough. I only needed to use the hint system once, for the musical sequence puzzle (which was admittedly quite tricky). The ending gave me genuine chills and made me want to replay the game to catch all the foreshadowing I might have missed. This is definitely one of the best browser-based escape rooms available - set aside a good chunk of time and prepare to be fully absorbed in unraveling this strange case!</p>
