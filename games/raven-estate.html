                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Navigate through Raven Estate using your mouse to interact with the environment. Click to move to accessible areas, examine objects, and collect items. Your inventory appears at the bottom of the screen - click on collected items to use them or combine them with other objects in the environment. Pay close attention to your surroundings, as crucial clues can be hidden in plain sight. Take notes of any symbols, numbers, or patterns you encounter, as they may be essential for solving puzzles later in the game. Listen carefully to audio cues, as they often provide hints or warnings of nearby dangers. Some puzzles have time constraints, so be prepared to think and act quickly. If you find yourself stuck, try examining your inventory items again or revisiting previously explored areas with new items. The game features a hint system that can be accessed if you're truly stumped - click the lightbulb icon in the corner of the screen for a subtle clue about your current objective. Remember that your choices matter - certain actions will influence the story's direction and ultimately determine which ending you receive.</p>

                            <p>Raven Estate is easily one of the best browser-based horror games I've played in years! The atmosphere is incredibly well-crafted - I found myself genuinely startled several times, especially during the library sequence. The puzzles are challenging without being frustratingly obscure, though I did get stuck for quite a while on the music box puzzle in the master bedroom. For anyone struggling with that one, pay close attention to the painting above the fireplace! I particularly appreciated how the story unfolds gradually through environmental storytelling rather than lengthy exposition. The multiple endings are a great touch too - I've played through twice now and got completely different conclusions. My only minor criticism would be that some of the later areas feel a bit rushed compared to the meticulously designed main house. If you enjoy atmospheric horror with substantial puzzle elements, this game is absolutely worth your time. Make sure to play with headphones for the full experience!</p>

                            <p>I came to Raven Estate expecting a standard point-and-click adventure, but was pleasantly surprised by the depth of both the puzzles and the storytelling. The developers have clearly put a lot of thought into creating puzzles that feel integrated with the environment and the narrative, rather than arbitrary obstacles. The basement puzzle sequence in particular stands out as brilliantly designed - the way it combines spatial reasoning with the narrative elements about the family's past was genuinely impressive. I also appreciate that the horror elements rely more on psychological tension and atmosphere rather than cheap jump scares (though there are a few well-placed ones!). The journal entries scattered throughout the mansion add layers to the story and provide subtle hints for the more challenging puzzles. One tip for new players: examine everything twice! Sometimes interacting with objects a second time after certain events will reveal new information. I managed to get what I think is the "good" ending on my first playthrough, but I'm definitely going back to explore the other possibilities.</p>
