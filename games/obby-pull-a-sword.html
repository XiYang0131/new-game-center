                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Use the arrow keys or WASD to move your character. Press the spacebar to jump. Double-tap the spacebar to perform a double jump once you've unlocked that ability. Navigate through the obstacle courses carefully, avoiding hazards such as lava, spikes, and moving traps. Falling off platforms will reset you to the last checkpoint, so take your time and plan your movements. At the end of each obstacle course, you'll find a sword embedded in stone or another surface. Approach the sword and hold the E key to pull it. Different swords grant different abilities - some might allow you to jump higher, move faster, or even temporarily fly. Use these abilities strategically to overcome more challenging obstacles in later levels. Collect coins throughout the levels to unlock character customizations and special items. Some areas may be locked until you've collected a certain number of swords or completed specific challenges. Pay attention to the environment for hidden paths or secret areas that might contain special rewards. If you're struggling with a particular obstacle, try using a different sword's ability to approach it in a new way. Remember that timing is crucial for many of the platforming challenges, especially those with moving parts.</p>

                            <p>This game is a perfect blend of platforming challenge and collection fun! I love how each sword you pull gives you a different ability that changes how you approach the obstacles. The Fire Sword's dash ability is super useful for crossing large gaps, while the Ice Sword's temporary platform creation saved me countless times in the lava levels. The difficulty curve is well-balanced - it starts accessible but gradually introduces more complex jumping patterns and timing challenges. Level 7 with the moving platforms was particularly tricky until I figured out the rhythm. For anyone struggling with the later levels, don't forget that you can switch between your collected swords at any time by pressing the number keys (1-9). Sometimes the solution is simply using a different sword's ability!</p>

                            <p>I've been playing this with my kids and they absolutely love it! The colorful graphics and straightforward controls make it accessible for younger players, while the later levels provide enough challenge to keep older gamers engaged. We've turned it into a family competition to see who can collect all the swords with the fewest falls. The hidden areas are a nice touch - we spent an entire evening just exploring the Crystal Cavern level looking for the secret passage to the Emerald Sword. My only suggestion would be to add a multiplayer mode so we could tackle the obstacles together. Otherwise, it's a fantastic game that's brought us hours of fun!</p>

                            <p>As someone who's played a lot of obstacle course games, I appreciate the unique twist that the sword-pulling mechanic adds to the formula. It gives you a sense of accomplishment beyond just reaching the end of a level. The controls are responsive and precise, which is crucial for a platformer. I particularly enjoy the variety in the obstacle designs - each level feels fresh and introduces new challenges rather than just recycling the same elements. The Shadow Realm levels with their inverted gravity mechanics were mind-bending in the best way! For those trying to collect all 25 swords, don't miss the tiny path behind the waterfall in the Jungle level - it leads to one of the rarest swords in the game. Looking forward to seeing what new levels and swords they might add in future updates!</p>
