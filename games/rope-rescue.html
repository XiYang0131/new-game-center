                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Click and drag to draw ropes between attachment points. The goal is to create paths that will guide the people to safety. Ropes behave according to realistic physics - they stretch, swing, and can break if too much tension is applied. Plan your rope placements carefully to create safe paths around obstacles. Some levels feature special elements like moving platforms, spikes, or buttons that need to be activated. Pay attention to the timing of your rescues, especially in levels with moving hazards. Try to complete each level using as few ropes as possible to earn a higher star rating. If you get stuck, you can restart the level at any time without penalty. As you progress, you'll need to combine multiple ropes and use the environment to your advantage. Remember that sometimes the solution requires thinking outside the box - the most direct path isn't always possible or safe. Experiment with different rope configurations and don't be afraid to try unconventional approaches.</p>

                            <p>This game is deceptively challenging! The first few levels ease you in nicely, but around level 15 things start getting really interesting. I love how it forces you to think about physics in a practical way - understanding how the ropes will behave under tension and gravity is key to solving the trickier levels. The level with the swinging pendulum (level 23) had me stumped for ages until I realized I needed to time my rope placement with the swing. For anyone struggling with the later levels, try to use as few ropes as possible - sometimes adding more ropes actually makes the solution more complicated than it needs to be.</p>

                            <p>I've been playing this with my kids and it's been a great way to teach them about basic physics concepts while having fun. They get so excited when they figure out a solution! The difficulty progression is well-balanced - challenging enough to make you think but not so hard that it becomes frustrating. We particularly enjoy the levels where you have to rescue multiple people with different paths. The graphics are cute and appealing, and the rope-drawing mechanic is intuitive enough that even my 6-year-old can play with a little guidance. Definitely recommend this for family gaming sessions.</p>

                            <p>As a physics teacher, I appreciate how this game accurately models rope physics while keeping the gameplay accessible and fun. I've actually used examples from this game in my classroom to demonstrate concepts like tension, gravity, and pendulum motion. The later levels provide some genuinely challenging puzzles that require careful thinking about how forces will interact. My only suggestion would be to add a slow-motion feature for some of the more timing-sensitive levels. For players who are struggling, remember that the attachment points aren't just for connecting ropes - they can also serve as pivot points or barriers. Looking forward to seeing if they add more levels in future updates!</p>
