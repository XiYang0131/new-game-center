                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>In Flag Arena - Capture & Dominate, the controls are designed to be intuitive while offering depth for skilled players. Use the WASD keys to move your character around the arena. The left mouse button is your primary attack, while the right mouse button activates your character's special ability. Press the Shift key to sprint, which consumes stamina (visible as a blue bar below your health). The spacebar allows you to jump or dodge, depending on your character class. Each match begins with team selection - you can choose to join the Red or Blue team, or let the game automatically balance the teams. Before entering the arena, you'll select your character class from several options: Assault (balanced offense and defense), Tank (high health but slower movement), Scout (fast movement with lower health), and Support (healing and buff abilities). The objective varies by game mode. In Capture the Flag, you must steal the enemy team's flag and return it to your base while defending your own flag. In Domination mode, teams compete to control marked territories on the map - the longer your team holds these points, the more points you accumulate. Communication is crucial for victory - use the in-game chat (press Enter) or quick commands (hold Tab and select options) to coordinate with teammates. Pay attention to the mini-map in the corner of the screen, which shows flag locations, controlled territories, and teammate positions. As you play matches, you'll earn experience points and currency that can be used to unlock new character skins, emotes, and temporary power-ups for future matches. Remember that different maps require different strategies - take time to learn the layout of each arena and discover advantageous positions for your chosen class.</p>

                            <p>I've been playing Flag Arena for about two weeks now, and I'm completely hooked! The balance between the different character classes is really well done - each has clear strengths and weaknesses that encourage teamwork. I mainly play as a Scout, focusing on quick flag captures while avoiding direct combat. The Mountain Fortress map is definitely my favorite - there are so many alternate routes and shortcuts that let you outmaneuver opponents if you know the layout well. One strategy that's been working great for my team is having a Tank and Support duo defend our flag while the rest of us focus on capturing. The recent update that added the new Arctic Base arena has been awesome too - the slippery ice sections add a whole new movement dynamic. If you're new to the game, I'd recommend starting with the Assault class until you get familiar with the maps, then experiment with other classes to find your preferred playstyle. The only minor issue I've encountered is occasional lag during peak hours, but it's usually resolved quickly. Overall, this is one of the most fun multiplayer browser games I've played in a long time!</p>

                            <p>Flag Arena strikes a perfect balance between accessibility and competitive depth. As someone who typically plays more complex strategy games, I was surprised by how much tactical nuance exists beneath the colorful, approachable exterior. The Domination mode in particular rewards thoughtful team composition and map control - my regular squad has developed several specialized formations depending on which territories spawn as high-value points. The Support class deserves special mention for being genuinely fun to play rather than just a necessary role - the ability to set up healing stations and buff teammates' movement speed can completely turn the tide of a match. I appreciate how the progression system focuses mainly on cosmetic rewards rather than power advantages, keeping matches fair regardless of how long you've been playing. The developers have been impressively responsive to community feedback too - the recent adjustment to the Tank class's shield cooldown addressed a balance issue that many players had identified. For anyone struggling with the game, I recommend using the Practice Arena to familiarize yourself with each map's layout before jumping into competitive matches. Also, don't forget that you can view the entire arena from above by pressing the M key - this overhead view is invaluable for planning routes and identifying contested areas. Looking forward to seeing how the game continues to evolve!</p>
