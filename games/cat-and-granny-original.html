                <h2>Game Description</h2>
                <p>Cat and Granny Original is a delightfully mischievous stealth adventure game that puts players in the paws of a troublemaking feline determined to wreak havoc in Granny's house while avoiding her watchful eye. Set in a charming, detailed household environment, the game combines stealth mechanics, puzzle-solving, and playful chaos in a uniquely feline package. Players control a nimble cat with a mission to cause as much mischief as possible - knocking over vases, shredding toilet paper, scratching furniture, and generally being the perfect cat nuisance - all while staying one step ahead of the determined Granny who's constantly on patrol to maintain order in her home. The game features a semi-open world design where different rooms of the house offer various opportunities for cat-style mayhem. Each area contains interactive objects that can be toppled, broken, or otherwise disturbed for points, with more difficult or risky targets yielding higher rewards. The challenge comes from balancing your mischief-making with stealth, as Granny patrols the house with increasingly vigilant patterns as the chaos increases. What makes Cat and Granny Original particularly engaging is its authentic "cat simulator" elements. The movement and abilities feel genuinely feline - from the nimble jumps to tight-space squeezing and even the classic "knock things off shelves" behavior that cat owners will immediately recognize. The game includes a progression system where successfully completing mischief objectives unlocks new areas of the house, additional cat abilities, and even costume customizations for your feline troublemaker. With its charming visuals, humorous animations, intuitive controls, and the perfect balance of stealth and chaos, Cat and Granny Original offers a uniquely entertaining experience that captures the essence of feline mischief. Whether you're a cat lover appreciating the authentic behaviors or simply someone who enjoys lighthearted stealth games with a twist, this game provides hours of purr-fectly entertaining gameplay.</p>

                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Cat and Granny Original features intuitive controls designed to make your feline mischief-making both accessible and enjoyable. On desktop, you'll primarily use the following controls: WASD or Arrow Keys for movement, allowing your cat to prowl around the house. Spacebar for jumping onto furniture, shelves, and other elevated surfaces. E or Enter key for interacting with objects (knocking things over, scratching furniture, etc.). Shift key for sprinting when you need to make a quick escape from Granny. Ctrl key for sneaking, which makes your movement quieter but slower. F key to use special cat abilities once unlocked. On mobile devices, the touch controls are adapted for smaller screens: Virtual joystick on the left side of the screen for movement. Action buttons on the right side for jumping, interacting, and special abilities. Dedicated sprint and sneak buttons when those actions are needed. When you first start the game, you'll be introduced to the basic mechanics through a brief tutorial that explains your objectives and controls. The main goal is to cause mischief around the house while avoiding being caught by Granny. Each level or area of the house has a "Mischief Meter" that you need to fill by interacting with various objects: Knocking items off shelves and tables. Scratching furniture and curtains. Unrolling toilet paper. Breaking fragile objects. Spilling liquids. Making noise to distract or annoy Granny. The challenge comes from avoiding Granny while causing chaos. She patrols the house in predictable patterns at first, but as you cause more mischief, she becomes more alert and her patrol patterns become more unpredictable. If Granny spots you, she'll chase after you. If caught, you'll lose progress and have to restart from the last checkpoint. To avoid being caught, you'll need to use stealth tactics: Hide under furniture when Granny is nearby. Use elevated paths like shelves and the tops of furniture to stay out of reach. Create distractions by knocking over distant objects to draw Granny away from your location. Use sprint to quickly escape when spotted, but be careful as running makes noise that can alert Granny to your location. The game includes various power-ups and special abilities that can be unlocked as you progress: "Shadow Cat" temporarily makes you harder for Granny to spot. "Sonic Meow" creates a distraction at a distance. "Nimble Paws" allows you to interact with objects more quickly. "Nine Lives" gives you an extra chance if caught. For beginners, here are some tips to get started: Take your time to observe Granny's patrol patterns before making your move. Start with easy-to-reach objects that won't make too much noise. Save your special abilities for when you really need them, like when you're cornered or need to create a crucial distraction. Remember that higher places are generally safer, as Granny can't reach you when you're on top of tall furniture or shelves. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock new areas of the house with different layouts and challenges. Each area has its own unique interactive objects and hiding spots to discover. The game saves your progress automatically when you complete objectives or reach new areas, so you can return to continue your mischievous adventure anytime. Remember that being a troublemaking cat is all about timing and opportunity - wait for the perfect moment to cause chaos, and always have an escape route planned!</p>

                            <p>As someone who lives with three cats, I can confidently say that Cat and Granny Original captures the essence of feline mischief with impressive accuracy! The developers clearly understand cat behavior - from the way your character slinks around corners to the paw-batting animation when knocking objects off shelves, it all feels authentically cat-like. What I appreciate most about this game is how it balances humor with genuinely engaging stealth gameplay. The satisfaction of successfully executing a perfect sequence of chaos while narrowly avoiding Granny's detection is surprisingly rewarding. I found myself planning routes through rooms and timing my mischief with the same strategic thinking I'd use in more serious stealth games. The progression system keeps things interesting as you unlock new areas. The kitchen was particularly challenging with its open layout and fewer hiding spots, but that made successfully ransacking it all the more satisfying. The unlockable abilities add nice variety to the gameplay - the "Sonic Meow" distraction is especially useful for those tight situations when Granny is blocking your escape route. For new players, I recommend focusing on learning Granny's patrol patterns before attempting the more valuable (and noisy) mischief opportunities. Also, don't underestimate the value of high places - jumping up to bookshelves and cabinet tops is often the safest way to navigate between rooms undetected. My only minor criticism would be that some of the later levels can feel a bit repetitive once you've mastered the core mechanics. I'd love to see future updates add more unique environmental interactions or perhaps different "grannies" with varied behaviors to keep the challenge fresh. Overall, Cat and Granny Original is a delightful game that perfectly captures both the joy of being a mischievous cat and the tension of stealth gameplay. It's become my go-to game when I need a quick break during the day - each room can be completed in 5-10 minutes, making it perfect for short gaming sessions. Highly recommended for cat lovers and stealth game fans alike!</p>

                            <p>I've played many stealth games over the years, from Splinter Cell to Hitman, and I was surprised by how well Cat and Granny Original adapts stealth mechanics to a lighthearted, accessible format without sacrificing the core tension that makes the genre enjoyable. The game cleverly uses its premise to create a stealth experience that feels fresh and unique. Instead of the usual arsenal of gadgets, you have natural cat abilities and behaviors that fit perfectly into the stealth framework. The sound design deserves special mention - the audio cues that alert you to Granny's proximity create genuine tension, and the satisfying crash of a vase hitting the floor after you've carefully positioned yourself for a quick escape route is oddly thrilling. What impressed me most was how the level design encourages experimentation and multiple approaches. Each room is essentially a stealth puzzle with various solutions depending on your play style. Do you go for quick hit-and-run tactics, or methodically clear one section at a time? Do you create distractions to manipulate Granny's patrol path, or rely on timing and hiding spots? This flexibility makes the game accessible to stealth newcomers while still offering depth for genre veterans. The difficulty curve is well-balanced too. Early rooms ease you into the mechanics with forgiving patrol patterns and plenty of hiding spots, while later areas require more precise timing and route planning. The bathroom level with its limited cover and echoing acoustics was particularly challenging in a satisfying way. For players coming from more traditional stealth games, I recommend embracing the unique "cat logic" of this game rather than applying human stealth tactics. Sometimes the best approach is the most chaotic one - creating a distraction by knocking something over in one room can clear your path in another. Also, the vertical space is your friend in ways that most stealth games don't explore - Granny can't reach you on top of tall furniture, creating safe observation points for planning your next move. My only suggestion for improvement would be adding more varied objectives beyond simply causing mischief. Perhaps missions like stealing specific items or completing challenges within time limits could add another layer of strategy to the experience. Overall, Cat and Granny Original is a refreshing take on stealth gameplay that proves you don't need high stakes or complex mechanics to create a compelling stealth experience. It's a perfect entry point for newcomers to the genre while still offering enough depth to satisfy experienced stealth gamers looking for something different.</p>
