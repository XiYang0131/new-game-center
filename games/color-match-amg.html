                <h2>Game Description</h2>
                <p>Color Match AMG is a fast-paced puzzle game that tests your color recognition skills and reflexes. The concept is simple yet challenging: match the color of the central object with the corresponding colored area before time runs out. As you progress, the game becomes increasingly difficult with faster time limits and more complex color patterns. With its minimalist design, addictive gameplay, and progressive difficulty, Color Match AMG offers a perfect quick gaming session that's easy to learn but difficult to master. Challenge yourself to beat your high score or compete with friends to see who has the fastest color recognition skills!</p>

                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>The game displays a central object with a specific color. Around this object are different colored areas or buttons. Your task is to click or tap on the colored area that matches the color of the central object before the timer runs out. Each correct match earns you points and advances you to the next level. As you progress, the time limit becomes shorter, and the color combinations may become more challenging to distinguish. Some levels might introduce additional elements like changing colors or distractions to increase the difficulty. Focus on quick recognition and decisive action - hesitation will cost you valuable seconds! If you make a mistake by selecting the wrong color, you'll lose a life. The game ends when you run out of lives or fail to match colors within the time limit. Your goal is to achieve the highest score possible by making as many correct matches as you can. Remember that practice improves your color recognition speed, so don't be discouraged if you struggle at first!</p>

                            <p>Color Match AMG is deceptively challenging! What starts as a simple color-matching game quickly becomes an intense test of reflexes and focus. I love how the difficulty progression is so well-balanced - just when you think you've mastered the timing, the game throws a new challenge at you. My highest score so far is 87, which I achieved by really getting into a flow state and focusing solely on the central color. One tip that helped me improve: try to look slightly above the central object so you can see all the color options in your peripheral vision, rather than having to scan each one individually. This game is perfect for quick play sessions during breaks, and I've noticed it's actually improved my reaction time in other games too! The minimalist design works perfectly for this type of game - no distractions, just pure color-matching challenge. If you're competitive like me, you'll find yourself saying "just one more try" over and over again!</p>

                            <p>This game has become my daily brain warm-up! I play a few rounds each morning to get my mind alert and focused for the day. The simplicity is what makes it so addictive - there's no complicated rules to remember, just pure reflex and color recognition. I appreciate how the game gradually increases in difficulty rather than throwing you into the deep end immediately. The later levels where colors start to look more similar (like distinguishing between close shades of blue or green) really test your perception skills. My strategy is to take a deep breath between levels and reset my focus - rushing from one match to the next often leads to careless mistakes. I've also found that playing in a well-lit room helps with accurate color recognition, especially in the more challenging levels. My only suggestion would be to add a colorblind mode for accessibility, but otherwise, this is a perfectly executed reflex game. My current high score is 73, but I'm determined to break 80 soon!</p>
