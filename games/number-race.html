                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Click or tap on numbers to select them. Your goal is to create mathematical equations that equal the target number shown at the top of the screen. You can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to reach the target number. In some levels, you'll need to clear all numbers from the board before time runs out. In others, you'll race against computer opponents or other players to solve equations faster. As you progress through the game, the equations become more complex and the time limits more challenging. Look for special tiles that provide bonuses such as extra time, hints, or the ability to skip difficult equations. In Time Attack mode, focus on solving equations as quickly as possible to earn the highest score. In Challenge Mode, you'll face increasingly difficult puzzles that test your mathematical skills to the limit. Use power-ups strategically - save them for when you're stuck on particularly challenging equations. Pay attention to the patterns in the numbers - sometimes there are multiple ways to reach the target number, and finding the most efficient solution will save you valuable time. Remember that in later levels, you may need to use multiple operations to reach the target number, so think creatively about how to combine the available numbers.</p>

                            <p>This game is a fantastic way to keep your mental math skills sharp! I've been playing it during my lunch breaks at work, and I've noticed I'm getting faster at calculating in my head. The difficulty progression is well-balanced - it starts simple enough that anyone can enjoy it, but gradually introduces more complex equations that really make you think. I particularly enjoy the Challenge Mode where you have to use all four operations to reach the target number. The time pressure adds a nice element of excitement that keeps me coming back for "just one more round." My high score in Time Attack mode is 12,450 - see if you can beat that!</p>

                            <p>As a math teacher, I've been recommending this game to my students as a fun way to practice their arithmetic skills. It's been a hit in my classroom! I love that it makes math feel like play rather than work. The visual design is engaging without being distracting, and the sound effects provide good feedback without becoming annoying. I've noticed that even my students who typically struggle with math are enjoying the game and improving their calculation speed. The different difficulty levels make it accessible to students of varying abilities. I would love to see a classroom version with the ability to track multiple students' progress - that would make it an even more valuable educational tool.</p>

                            <p>I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy a math-based game since I was never the best at arithmetic in school, but Number Race has completely won me over! The gameplay is so engaging that I don't even realize I'm practicing math. The power-ups add a nice strategic element - saving the "Freeze Time" power-up for particularly difficult equations has saved me many times. I find the multiplayer mode especially fun when playing with friends - nothing like a little friendly competition to motivate you to calculate faster! One tip for beginners: don't always go for the first solution you see. Sometimes taking an extra second to look for a more efficient combination of numbers can save you time in the long run. My only suggestion would be to add more visual themes or customization options to keep the game feeling fresh after extended play.</p>
