                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Use WASD keys to move your character, and the mouse to aim. Left-click to fire your weapon, right-click to aim down sights for improved accuracy (with applicable weapons). Press Space to jump, Shift to sprint, and R to reload. The number keys (1-9) or scroll wheel can be used to switch between weapons in your loadout. Press Tab to view the scoreboard during matches. Each game mode has different objectives - in Team Deathmatch, work with your team to eliminate opponents; in Free-for-All, it's every player for themselves; in Capture the Flag, secure the enemy flag while protecting your own. Pay attention to the mini-map to track objectives and teammate positions. Experiment with different weapons to find those that match your playstyle - some excel at close range, while others are better for long-distance engagements. Use the environment for cover and strategic positioning. Remember that headshots deal increased damage, so aim carefully. As you play and earn experience, you'll unlock new customization options and weapons to expand your arsenal!</p>

                            <p>Kirka.io has quickly become my go-to browser FPS! The controls are surprisingly responsive for a browser game, and the weapon balance is well-thought-out. I particularly enjoy the sniper rifles - landing those long-distance headshots is incredibly satisfying. The variety of maps keeps the gameplay fresh, with each one requiring different tactics. Sandstorm is great for sniping, while Factory encourages more close-quarters combat. The progression system gives a nice sense of accomplishment as you unlock new skins and weapons. For new players, I recommend starting with the assault rifle until you get comfortable with the movement and aiming mechanics. Once you've got the basics down, try the shotgun on smaller maps - it's devastating at close range! The community is generally competitive but friendly, and the team modes are a lot of fun when you coordinate with teammates. My only suggestion would be to add more customization options for characters, but that's a minor nitpick for an otherwise excellent browser FPS.</p>

                            <p>This game strikes the perfect balance between accessibility and depth! I love that I can jump in for a quick match during a short break, but there's also enough tactical nuance to keep me engaged for longer sessions. The blocky visual style might seem simple at first, but it actually helps with visibility and performance, allowing the game to run smoothly even on older computers. Capture the Flag is my favorite mode - the rush of grabbing the enemy flag and making a mad dash back to your base while your teammates provide cover fire is exhilarating! I've found that communication is key in team modes, so don't be shy about using the chat function to coordinate with teammates. One strategy that's worked well for me is to adjust my loadout based on the map and mode - SMGs for indoor areas, rifles for more open spaces. The developers deserve credit for how frequently they update the game with new content and balance adjustments. If you're looking for a browser FPS that doesn't require a download but still offers a complete multiplayer experience, Kirka.io is definitely worth checking out!</p>
