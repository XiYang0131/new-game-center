                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Poxel.io features intuitive controls that are easy to pick up. Use the WASD keys to move your character around the world. The mouse controls your view direction, and left-clicking allows you to break blocks or attack other players. Right-clicking places blocks or uses items. The spacebar makes your character jump, which is useful for navigating terrain or escaping danger. When you first join a match, you'll be dropped into the game world with nothing but your harvesting tool. Your first priority should be gathering resources by breaking blocks in the environment. Different materials have different properties - wood is quick to gather but offers minimal protection, while stone and metal are more durable but take longer to mine. Press E to open your inventory and crafting menu. Here, you can see the resources you've collected and craft them into useful items. Basic recipes include walls for protection, stairs for mobility, and various weapons. The number keys (1-9) allow you to quickly switch between items in your hotbar. As you explore, you may find special items or resource caches that provide rare materials for crafting more powerful weapons or tools. Keep an eye on the map or compass to track the shrinking safe zone. Staying outside this zone will cause you to take damage over time. As the playable area decreases, you'll be forced closer to enemy players, leading to more frequent encounters. Combat involves a combination of building and fighting. Quickly constructing walls for cover, creating high ground advantages, or setting traps can be just as effective as direct attacks. Different weapons have different ranges and damage outputs - melee weapons are powerful up close but leave you vulnerable, while ranged weapons allow you to attack from a distance but require good aim. The last player or team standing wins the match. Remember that stealth and strategy can sometimes be more effective than aggressive play - choose your battles wisely and be aware of your surroundings at all times. For new players, it's recommended to spend some time practicing building and combat techniques before diving into competitive matches. The game also offers team modes where you can play with friends and coordinate strategies together.</p>

                            <p>Poxel.io has completely taken over my gaming time! The combination of building mechanics and battle royale gameplay creates such a dynamic experience where no two matches feel the same. After playing for about a month, I've found that the "quick fort" strategy works really well in the early game - gathering just enough resources to build a small defensive structure before hunting for better weapons. The crystal caves in the center of the map are high-risk but high-reward - the rare materials there let you craft the powerful Plasma Rifle, which is a game-changer in the final circles. For new players, I recommend focusing on movement and building basics before trying to take on fights. Being able to quickly build a wall when under fire or construct a ramp to gain height advantage is often more important than perfect aim. The recent update that added the grappling hook item has added another layer of mobility that makes traversal so much more fun. My favorite moment so far was using it to swing underneath an enemy's fortress and surprise them from below! The only minor issue I've encountered is occasional lag during very busy endgame scenarios with lots of building and destruction happening simultaneously, but it's not enough to detract from the overall experience. If you enjoy both creative building games and competitive shooters, this is the perfect blend of both worlds!</p>

                            <p>As someone who's played most of the popular battle royale games out there, I can confidently say that Poxel.io brings something fresh to the genre. The voxel-based environment creates opportunities for strategy that just don't exist in other games - I love how you can literally reshape the battlefield to your advantage. The learning curve is just right - basic controls are intuitive enough that you can jump in and have fun immediately, but there's enough depth to the building and combat systems that you can keep improving for weeks. I've found that the shotgun + quick walls combo is particularly effective for close-range encounters. When someone rushes you, quickly building a wall, editing a window, and firing a shotgun blast can end fights before they really begin. The different biomes on the map each have their strategic advantages - the desert has great visibility but limited cover, while the forest provides natural concealment but makes it harder to spot enemies at a distance. Team mode is where this game really shines though. Coordinating with friends where one player focuses on building defenses while others gather resources or scout for enemies creates a really satisfying tactical experience. My suggestion for improvement would be adding more variety to the endgame - perhaps dynamic events or environmental hazards that force players to adapt their strategies on the fly. Overall though, this is easily one of the most engaging multiplayer experiences I've had in a browser game. The developers clearly understand what makes both building games and battle royales fun, and they've merged those elements perfectly!</p>
