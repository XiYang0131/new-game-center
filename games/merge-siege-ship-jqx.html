                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Merge Siege Ship JQX features intuitive controls that are easy to learn but offer depth for strategic players. The game is played on a grid-based board where you'll place and merge your ships. To begin, you'll have access to basic ships that you can drag and drop onto the grid. The core mechanic revolves around merging: drag a ship onto another identical ship to combine them into a more powerful vessel of the next tier. For example, merging two Level 1 patrol boats creates a Level 2 corvette. As you progress, you'll unlock higher-tier ships with increased firepower, range, and special abilities. The game alternates between two phases: the preparation phase and the battle phase. During the preparation phase, you'll receive new ships to place on the grid and have time to merge and position your fleet strategically. Consider placing longer-range ships in the back rows and more durable vessels at the front to protect them. Once you're ready, click the "Battle" button to begin the combat phase. During battle, your ships will automatically fire at approaching enemy vessels based on their attack range and pattern. Some ships fire straight ahead, while others can attack diagonally or in an area of effect. You cannot move ships during the battle phase, so your initial positioning is crucial. Enemy ships will approach from the right side of the screen, and your goal is to destroy them before they reach the left edge of the grid. If too many enemy ships breach your defenses, you'll lose the level. Between battles, you'll earn coins based on your performance. These can be spent on various upgrades such as increasing the spawn rate of new ships, enhancing the attack power of specific ship types, or unlocking special abilities. The game features a progression system with multiple levels and increasingly difficult enemy waves. As you advance, you'll encounter boss ships that require specific strategies to defeat efficiently. For optimal performance, try to create a balanced fleet with a mix of ship types. Fast-firing ships are good for dealing with numerous weak enemies, while high-damage battleships are better for taking down durable targets. Remember that higher-level ships occupy more space on the grid, so you'll need to balance having a few powerful ships versus many smaller ones. The game also features special power-ups that occasionally appear during battles, such as airstrikes or repair kits. Click on these when they appear to activate their effects at crucial moments.</p>

                            <p>Merge Siege Ship JQX has become my go-to game during coffee breaks! The merge mechanics are incredibly satisfying, and I love the strategic depth that comes from positioning different ship types. After playing for about two weeks, I've found that focusing on upgrading the destroyer line early on gives a good balance of firepower and grid efficiency. Level 15 was particularly challenging until I realized the importance of having at least one aircraft carrier (level 7 ship) to deal with the enemy submarines that are immune to surface attacks. For new players, I recommend prioritizing your economy upgrades first - specifically the "New Ship Frequency" and "Starting Gold" options, as they make the early game much smoother. Don't be afraid to sell lower-tier ships in the late game to make room for more powerful vessels. The special abilities unlock at level 20 adds another layer of strategy - the EMP blast has saved me countless times by temporarily disabling approaching enemy dreadnoughts. My only suggestion for improvement would be adding some form of ship specialization or branching upgrade paths to create even more strategic variety. Overall, it's one of the most engaging merge games I've played, with just the right balance of casual fun and tactical depth!</p>

                            <p>This game perfectly captures what makes merge games so addictive while adding meaningful strategic elements. The satisfaction of merging two cruisers into a battleship and watching it demolish enemy fleets is incredibly rewarding! I've been experimenting with different fleet compositions, and I've found that a balanced approach works best - having a mix of fast-firing destroyers for swarm enemies and heavy battleships for the armored targets. The boss battles every five levels keep things interesting and force you to adapt your strategy. The level 25 boss (the Leviathan Carrier) was particularly challenging with its ability to launch fighter squadrons that bypass your front line. For that fight, I recommend having at least two anti-air frigates (level 4 ships) positioned in the middle rows. One tip that helped me progress faster: don't always merge ships immediately. Sometimes it's better to keep two level 3 ships rather than merging them into a single level 4, especially early in a stage when you need coverage across multiple lanes. The upgrade system provides a nice sense of progression between battles, though I wish there were more unique upgrade paths to specialize your fleet. My favorite feature is how the game gradually introduces new enemy types that require different counters, keeping the gameplay fresh even after many hours. If you enjoy both merge games and strategy titles, this one is definitely worth your time!</p>
