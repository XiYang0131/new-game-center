                <h2>Game Description</h2>
                <p>Dig Tycoon - Idle Game 3D is an engaging mining simulation that puts you in charge of building and expanding your own mining empire. Starting with just a simple pickaxe, you'll dig for valuable minerals, sell your findings, and reinvest your earnings to purchase better equipment, hire workers, and unlock new mining areas. The game features attractive 3D graphics that let you watch your mining operation grow in real-time. What makes Dig Tycoon particularly addictive is its idle gameplay mechanics - your miners continue to work and generate income even when you're not actively playing, allowing you to return to a wealth of resources. With a wide variety of upgrades, achievements to unlock, and depths to explore, this game offers a satisfying progression system that will keep you coming back to expand your underground empire.</p>
                
                <p>Game Features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Detailed 3D mining simulation with vibrant visuals and smooth animations</li>
                    <li>Idle progression system that generates resources even when you're not playing</li>
                    <li>Extensive upgrade tree for mining equipment, worker efficiency, and automation</li>
                    <li>Multiple mining locations with different minerals and challenges to discover</li>
                    <li>Achievement system and prestige mechanics for long-term progression</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="game-instructions">
                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>When you first start Dig Tycoon, you'll begin with a basic mining operation. Click or tap on the screen to manually mine resources - each click represents a swing of your pickaxe. As you collect minerals, your money will increase, which you can then spend on upgrades. Access the upgrade menu by clicking the shop icon, where you'll find options to improve your mining equipment, hire workers, and unlock new technologies. Upgrading your pickaxe increases the amount of resources you get per click, while hiring workers allows for automatic mining even when you're not actively clicking. As you progress, you'll unlock managers who can automate different aspects of your operation, allowing for more idle gameplay. Keep an eye on the depth indicator - different minerals become available as you dig deeper, with rarer and more valuable resources found at greater depths. The game features multiple mining locations that you can unlock with enough money, each with its own unique resources and challenges. To maximize your efficiency, balance your upgrades between manual mining power, worker capacity, and automation. Remember that your operation continues to generate income even when the game is closed, so check back regularly to collect your earnings and invest in new upgrades. For long-term players, the prestige system allows you to reset your progress in exchange for permanent bonuses that make subsequent playthroughs more efficient and rewarding.</p>

                            <p>Dig Tycoon has become my go-to game during breaks! The 3D visuals really set it apart from other idle games - watching your mining operation expand and seeing the workers busily digging is surprisingly satisfying. I've found that focusing on upgrading your drill capacity early on gives the best return on investment, especially before your first prestige. Once you reach the crystal caverns (around 500m depth), the game really opens up with new upgrade paths. My current strategy is to balance worker count and efficiency upgrades, with occasional boosts to storage capacity when needed. The offline earnings are generous compared to many idle games, which is great for casual players. One tip for newcomers: save up for the "Automated Mineral Sorter" as soon as possible - it dramatically increases your earnings by optimizing which minerals your workers prioritize. After three prestiges, I'm still discovering new content and challenges. Definitely worth sticking with beyond the initial grind!</p>

                            <p>This game strikes a perfect balance between active play and idle progression. Unlike many idle games that quickly become "set and forget," Dig Tycoon keeps me engaged with meaningful choices about upgrade paths and resource allocation. The 3D graphics are a nice touch - being able to rotate and zoom around your mining operation adds a level of immersion that 2D idle games lack. I particularly enjoy the research system that unlocks new technologies as you progress deeper. For maximum efficiency, I recommend focusing on the "Mineral Value" research path first, as it provides a global multiplier to all your earnings. The diamond mine location (unlocked after your first prestige) is where the game really shines, with new mechanics and challenges to overcome. My only minor criticism would be that some of the later upgrades feel a bit grindy to reach, but the prestige system helps alleviate this. Overall, it's one of the more polished idle games I've played, and I keep coming back to check on my mining empire's progress!</p>
