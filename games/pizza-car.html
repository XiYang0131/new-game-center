                <h2>About Pizza Car</h2>
                <p>Pizza Car is a fun and challenging driving simulation game where you take on the role of a pizza delivery driver.

                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Use the arrow keys or WASD to control your vehicle. Up/W accelerates, Down/S brakes and reverses, Left/A and Right/D steer. Press Space to use the handbrake for tight turns. The mini-map in the corner shows your current location, delivery destinations, and the optimal route. Green markers indicate pickup locations, while red markers show delivery destinations. Complete deliveries within the time limit to earn maximum tips. Be careful not to damage your vehicle or the pizzas - excessive bumps or crashes will reduce your delivery quality and earnings. Use your earned money to upgrade your vehicle's speed, handling, and durability, or save up to purchase entirely new vehicles. As you progress, you'll unlock new districts with more challenging delivery routes and better-paying customers. Remember that different weather conditions affect your vehicle's handling - drive more carefully in rain or snow. Take advantage of shortcuts and alleyways to beat the delivery timer, but watch out for obstacles!</p>

                            <p>This game is surprisingly addictive! I started playing thinking I'd just try it for a few minutes, and two hours later I was still trying to beat my delivery times. The physics are pretty good for a browser game, and I love how each vehicle handles differently. The sports car is super fast but hard to control, while the delivery van is slower but much more stable. Pro tip: Save up for the suspension upgrades before buying a new vehicle - they make a huge difference when you're taking corners at high speed. The downtown district in the rain is probably the toughest challenge so far!</p>

                            <p>As someone who actually worked as a pizza delivery driver in college, this game captures the rush of trying to make deliveries on time pretty well! Obviously it's more arcade-style than realistic, but that makes it more fun. I appreciate that there are consequences for driving recklessly - smashing into things actually affects your rating and tips. The night driving challenges add an extra layer of difficulty that I enjoy. My only suggestion would be to add more variety to the customer interactions - maybe some special delivery challenges or unique customers with specific requirements.</p>

                            <p>This is a perfect game to play when you just have a few minutes to kill. Each delivery mission is quick enough that you can play a couple in a short break, but the progression system keeps you coming back for more. I've found that memorizing the map and finding shortcuts is key to getting the best times. There's this one alley between the mall and the park that saves so much time on north-side deliveries! The customization options are a nice touch too - I've got my car painted bright red with flame decals, very fitting for a speedy pizza delivery vehicle. Looking forward to unlocking the final district!</p>
