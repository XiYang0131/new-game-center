                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Mad Royale Tactics is easy to learn but offers depth for strategic players. When you start the game, you'll be given a set of starter heroes to form your initial team. The main gameplay loop consists of two phases: the preparation phase and the battle phase. During the preparation phase, you'll select which heroes to deploy from your roster and position them on your side of the battlefield grid. Consider each hero's strengths and abilities when deciding their placement. Front-line warriors should typically be placed in forward positions to protect more vulnerable ranged units like archers and mages, who are best positioned in the back rows. Some heroes have abilities that affect adjacent allies, so positioning them next to compatible units can create powerful synergies. Pay attention to the terrain features on the battlefield, as some tiles may provide defensive bonuses or other effects. Once you've finalized your formation, click the "Battle" button to begin the combat phase. During the battle phase, units will automatically move and attack according to their AI behavior. You cannot directly control them at this point, which is why your initial positioning is so crucial. Heroes will use their basic attacks and special abilities based on cooldowns and conditions. The battle continues until all units on one side are defeated. After each battle, you'll earn rewards based on your performance. These rewards include gold, experience points for your heroes, and sometimes new hero cards. Use gold to upgrade your existing heroes, increasing their stats and enhancing their abilities. As you progress through the campaign or compete in the arena, you'll face increasingly challenging opponents with more complex team compositions. Experiment with different hero combinations and formations to counter specific enemy strategies. Some heroes work particularly well together due to class synergies or complementary abilities. For example, pairing a tank hero with a healer can create a durable frontline, while combining multiple mages might unleash devastating area damage. Remember that team balance is important - a well-rounded team with different unit types often performs better than a team focused on just one strategy. The game also features a hero collection aspect, where you'll gradually unlock new heroes with unique abilities, expanding your strategic options.</p>

                            <p>Mad Royale Tactics has completely taken over my gaming time! The depth of strategy is impressive for a browser game - I love how much thought goes into positioning and team composition. After playing for about three weeks, I've found that the Berserker + Enchanter + Marksman combo is incredibly powerful, especially if you position the Enchanter to buff both damage dealers. The campaign gets quite challenging around stage 15, where enemy teams start having multiple synergies. For new players struggling with that section, I recommend focusing on upgrading a core team of 6-7 heroes rather than spreading resources too thin across many units. The Frozen Peaks arena is my favorite battleground because the ice tiles add an interesting tactical element - units sliding after being hit can completely change the outcome of a battle! I've also discovered that the Assassin class heroes are much more effective when placed on the flanks rather than directly in front, as they'll automatically target enemy backline units. My only minor criticism would be that some heroes feel slightly underpowered compared to others of the same rarity (looking at you, Alchemist), but the developers seem to be actively balancing the game with regular updates. Overall, it's one of the most engaging strategy games I've played in a browser!</p>

                            <p>As someone who loves auto-battlers but doesn't always have time for lengthy gaming sessions, Mad Royale Tactics hits the perfect sweet spot. The matches are quick enough to play during a short break, but there's enough strategic depth to keep me engaged and thinking about team compositions even when I'm not playing. I've been experimenting with different team synergies, and I've found that class bonuses make a huge difference in the later stages. A full Guardian team with their shared defense buff can be nearly unkillable if properly positioned, while a Mage Council (3+ mages) can wipe out enemy teams before they even reach your front line. The daily challenges are a great addition that forces you to think outside your comfort zone and try heroes you might not normally use. For anyone struggling with gold management, I recommend focusing on the daily bounties - they give substantial rewards for relatively simple tasks. The hero upgrade system strikes a good balance between progression and challenge; it feels rewarding without being too grindy. My favorite discovery so far has been how terrain effects can be used strategically - placing ranged units on high ground for the damage bonus, or positioning pushback heroes near hazard tiles to knock enemies into damage zones. If the developers are reading this, my only request would be for a tournament mode where you could compete against other players' teams in a bracket-style competition. Fantastic game overall that I keep coming back to!</p>
