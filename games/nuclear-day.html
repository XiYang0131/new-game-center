                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>In Nuclear Day, your primary goal is to survive as long as possible in the post-apocalyptic wasteland. When you start the game, you'll need to immediately search for resources - food, water, weapons, and building materials are essential. Use WASD or arrow keys to move your character, and the mouse to look around and aim. Left-click to use your equipped item or weapon, and right-click to aim down sights for more accurate shots. Press E to interact with objects and containers in the environment. The inventory can be accessed by pressing I, and the crafting menu by pressing C. To build structures, press B to enter building mode, then select the structure you want to create from the radial menu. Remember to monitor your health, hunger, thirst, and radiation levels displayed at the bottom of the screen. As night approaches, you'll need to find or create shelter, as darkness brings additional dangers. The game features a permadeath system, so be cautious with your decisions and always plan ahead. For beginners, focus on finding a safe location and establishing a basic shelter before venturing too far from your starting area. Good luck, survivor!</p>

                            <p>Nuclear Day has completely redefined what I expect from a browser-based survival game! The attention to detail in the environment is incredible - from the rusted, abandoned vehicles to the crumbling infrastructure and dynamic weather effects. I've been playing for about two weeks now and I'm still discovering new areas and survival strategies. What really sets this game apart is how it balances resource management with action. You can't just run-and-gun your way through - ammunition is scarce, and sometimes stealth is your only viable option. I've found that establishing a base near a water source and focusing on farming early on provides the most sustainable long-term strategy. The radiation system adds another layer of complexity that forces you to carefully plan your expeditions into high-risk, high-reward zones. For new players struggling with the difficulty, I recommend prioritizing crafting a radiation suit and water purifier before anything else. The day/night cycle is brilliantly implemented too - the tension that builds as the sun sets and you hear distant howls is genuinely nerve-wracking. My only minor criticism would be that the inventory management can feel a bit clunky at times, but that's a small issue in an otherwise exceptional game. Definitely the most immersive survival experience I've played this year!</p>

                            <p>As someone who's played pretty much every survival game out there, I can confidently say that Nuclear Day stands out for its strategic depth. Most games in this genre eventually devolve into mindless resource gathering, but Nuclear Day maintains tension throughout with its dynamic threat system. The way hostile NPCs adapt to your play style is particularly impressive - if you rely heavily on traps, they'll eventually start to recognize and avoid them. If you're aggressive, they'll start traveling in larger groups. This creates a constantly evolving challenge that keeps the game fresh even after dozens of hours. The building system deserves special praise too. Unlike many survival games where you can create unrealistic floating structures, Nuclear Day implements physics-based building that requires proper support and planning. My current base is built into the side of a cliff with multiple escape routes - a necessity given how the game's raid events can come from any direction. The crafting progression feels well-balanced, with meaningful upgrades that significantly impact gameplay rather than just incremental stat boosts. I particularly appreciate the different "survival styles" you can specialize in - I've focused on the "Scavenger" approach with stealth and trap skills, but my friend plays as a "Warlord" with heavy weapons and fortifications, and both approaches are viable. If you're looking for a survival game with genuine depth and replayability, Nuclear Day is absolutely worth your time. Just be prepared for a steep learning curve in the first few hours!</p>
