                <h2>Game Description</h2>
                <p>Trash Cafe is an innovative simulation game that combines environmental awareness with business management. In this unique game, you'll run a cafe that specializes in recycling waste materials and transforming them into useful products. As the owner of Trash Cafe, you'll sort different types of waste, process them through various recycling machines, and create eco-friendly items to sell to your customers. Balance your resources, upgrade your equipment, and expand your cafe while spreading awareness about sustainability and waste management. With its charming visuals, engaging gameplay mechanics, and important environmental message, Trash Cafe offers both entertainment and education about the importance of recycling.</p>
                
                <p>Game Features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Comprehensive waste sorting and recycling simulation with multiple material types</li>
                    <li>Cafe management system with customer satisfaction mechanics</li>
                    <li>Crafting system to create various eco-friendly products from recycled materials</li>

                    <li>Educational content about recycling processes and environmental sustainability</li>

                <div class="game-instructions">
                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Start by collecting waste materials that arrive at your cafe. Sort them into the correct categories (plastic, paper, metal, glass, etc.) by dragging them to the appropriate recycling bins. Process these materials using your recycling machines - each machine handles specific types of waste and converts them into usable recycled materials. Use these recycled materials to craft various products that you can sell in your cafe. Manage your resources carefully, as different products require different combinations of materials. Serve customers efficiently to maintain a good reputation and earn more income. Use your earnings to upgrade your equipment for faster processing, expand your cafe space, and unlock new recycling technologies. Complete special orders and environmental challenges to earn bonuses and progress through the game. Remember that proper sorting is crucial - incorrectly sorted waste will contaminate your recycling process and reduce efficiency. As you advance, you'll unlock more complex recycling chains and product recipes, allowing you to create higher-value items and attract more environmentally conscious customers.</p>

                            <p>Trash Cafe is such a refreshing concept! I love how it combines fun gameplay with environmental education. The sorting mechanics are surprisingly addictive, and I've actually learned a lot about different recycling processes. The progression system is well-balanced - upgrading your machines feels rewarding and opens up new possibilities. My favorite part is creating the upcycled furniture from what would otherwise be waste. The only challenge I found was managing the cafe during rush hours while also keeping up with the recycling tasks. Pro tip: prioritize upgrading your sorting station first, as it becomes the bottleneck later in the game. Highly recommend this to anyone interested in management sims with a meaningful message!</p>

                            <p>This game has quickly become one of my favorites! The concept is unique and the execution is excellent. I appreciate how the game teaches about recycling without being preachy - it just naturally incorporates environmental concepts into fun gameplay mechanics. The graphics are cute and colorful, making even trash sorting visually appealing. I found the customer AI to be quite realistic - they get impatient if you're slow and appreciate when you create exactly what they're looking for. One strategy that worked well for me was focusing on specializing in one type of recycled product early on (I chose paper products) before diversifying. This allowed me to upgrade those specific machines faster and establish a reputation for quality in that category. The developers have created something special here that's both entertaining and meaningful.</p>
