                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Click on cards in your hand to play them. Each card costs a certain amount of mana, shown in the top right corner of the card. Your mana pool replenishes and increases slightly each turn. Cards can be creatures that stay on the battlefield, spells that have immediate effects, or artifacts that provide ongoing benefits. Creatures can attack enemy creatures or the opponent directly, but most cannot attack the same turn they are played. Plan your moves carefully, considering both immediate threats and long-term strategy. Each of the five character classes (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Cleric, and Druid) has a unique playstyle and special abilities. Warriors focus on powerful creatures and weapons, Mages specialize in damaging spells, Rogues excel at combos and card draw, Clerics focus on healing and protection, and Druids utilize nature-based abilities and transformation. As you progress through the campaign, you'll earn new cards, experience points, and resources. Use these to improve your deck and upgrade your character's abilities. Pay attention to card synergies - some cards become much more powerful when played together with certain other cards. The "Discover" mechanic allows you to choose one of three randomly selected cards to add to your hand, giving you strategic options during battle. Some powerful cards have special requirements or drawbacks - weigh these carefully when building your deck. In difficult battles, consider saving your most powerful cards for the right moment rather than playing them as soon as possible. Experiment with different deck compositions to find what works best for your playstyle and to counter specific enemy strategies.</p>

                            <p>This is easily one of the best card games I've played in years! The depth of strategy is impressive - there are so many viable deck archetypes that I'm still discovering new combinations after weeks of playing. The Mage class with a spell-damage focused deck has been my favorite so far, but I recently tried a Druid transformation deck that's surprisingly effective against the later bosses. The balance between classes is well done, with each having clear strengths and weaknesses without any feeling overpowered. The storyline is actually engaging too, which is rare for a card game. The Ancient Forest area has some of the toughest encounters - the Treant Elder boss with its healing abilities can be a real challenge unless you have cards that can deal with regeneration. For new players, I recommend focusing on a consistent deck theme rather than just including all your strongest cards. A deck with good synergy will outperform a collection of individually powerful cards that don't work well together.</p>

                            <p>I was drawn to this game for the RPG elements, and I haven't been disappointed! The way your character progresses alongside your card collection creates a satisfying sense of development. The artwork is gorgeous - each card feels like it tells its own little story, and the environments are atmospheric and detailed. I appreciate that the game is generous with its rewards; you can build a competitive deck without spending real money, which is refreshing. The tutorial does a good job of explaining the basics, but there's a lot of depth to discover as you play. My favorite mechanic is the "Ritual" system, where playing certain cards in a specific sequence can summon powerful entities - it adds an extra layer of planning to each turn. The only improvement I'd suggest would be adding more character customization options. If you're struggling with the Shadow Keep area, try including more cards with the "Banish" keyword - they're essential for dealing with the ghost-type enemies there.</p>

                            <p>As someone who's played many card games competitively, I'm impressed by the strategic depth of Dark Stones. The resource management aspect is particularly well-implemented - deciding when to play your cards versus saving resources for future turns creates meaningful decisions every step of the way. The "Stance" system for Warriors is brilliantly designed, allowing you to adapt your strategy mid-battle depending on whether you need to be aggressive or defensive. I've found that the most successful decks tend to focus on a specific mana curve rather than just including powerful cards - having a smooth progression from early to late game is crucial. The legendary "Void Whisperer" card seems overpowered at first glance, but it actually has several effective counters if you know what you're doing. For advanced players looking for a challenge, try the "Ascension Trials" after completing the main campaign - they require highly optimized decks and perfect play to overcome. The developers deserve credit for creating a game that's accessible to newcomers while offering enough complexity to satisfy veteran card game players.</p>
