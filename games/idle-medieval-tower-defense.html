                <h2>Game Description</h2>
                <p>Idle Medieval Tower Defense combines the strategic depth of tower defense games with the satisfying progression of idle games. Set in a medieval fantasy world, you'll build and upgrade various defensive towers to protect your kingdom from endless waves of invading enemies. What makes this game unique is that your defenses continue to earn resources even when you're not actively playing, allowing for meaningful progression each time you return. With a wide variety of towers to unlock, enemies to defeat, and upgrades to purchase, this addictive game offers both active strategic gameplay and passive resource generation that will keep you coming back to strengthen your defenses and push back the invading hordes.</p>
                
                <p>Game Features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiple tower types with unique abilities and attack patterns</li>
                    <li>Idle progression system that generates resources even while you're away</li>
                    <li>Diverse enemy types requiring different defensive strategies</li>
                    <li>Deep upgrade system for towers, resource generation, and special abilities</li>
                    <li>Prestige system that allows you to reset with powerful permanent bonuses</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="game-instructions">
                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Start by placing basic towers along the enemy path by clicking on available building spots. Each tower has a specific range, attack speed, and damage output, so position them strategically to maximize their effectiveness. As enemies are defeated, you'll earn gold that can be spent on building new towers or upgrading existing ones. Click on a tower to view its upgrade options and statistics. The upgrade menu allows you to increase a tower's damage, range, attack speed, or unlock special abilities. In addition to gold earned from defeating enemies, you'll also generate passive income over time - this continues even when you're not playing the game. Use this idle income to make significant progress between active play sessions. As you advance, you'll unlock new tower types with unique abilities, such as splash damage, slowing effects, or critical hits. Adapt your strategy based on the types of enemies you're facing - some enemies are resistant to certain tower types or have special abilities of their own. The wave counter at the top of the screen shows your progress, with boss waves appearing periodically that are significantly more challenging. If too many enemies reach the end of the path, you'll lose health points. When your health reaches zero, you'll need to restart the current wave. Eventually, you'll unlock the prestige system, which allows you to reset your progress in exchange for powerful permanent upgrades that make subsequent playthroughs faster and more efficient. Remember to check the game regularly to collect your idle resources and make strategic upgrades to your defenses!</p>

                            <p>Idle Medieval Tower Defense has completely taken over my gaming time! The balance between active play and idle progression is perfect - I can enjoy strategic tower placement when I have time to play actively, but still make meaningful progress when I'm busy with other things. After my third prestige, I've found that focusing on upgrading the archer towers first gives the best early game advantage, especially if you position them at choke points. The fire wizard towers become essential later on when dealing with the armored enemies that start appearing around wave 50. My current strategy is to have a mix of slowing ice towers at the entrance, followed by high DPS archer and wizard towers, with a few bomb towers for crowd control. If you're new to the game, don't underestimate the importance of the economy upgrades - they significantly boost your idle earnings and make the game much more enjoyable in the long run!</p>

                            <p>This game strikes the perfect balance between complexity and accessibility. Unlike some idle games that play themselves entirely, the tower defense element keeps me engaged and thinking strategically. I've prestiged five times now, and each run feels fresh as I experiment with different tower combinations and placement strategies. The progression curve is well-designed - just when things start to feel grindy, you unlock a new tower type or ability that changes up the gameplay. For those struggling with the boss on wave 100, I found that upgrading the lightning towers to max level and placing them near the end of the path works wonders. They can chain damage between the boss and its minions, effectively doubling your damage output. My only suggestion for improvement would be adding more variety to the maps, as the single path gets a bit repetitive after a while. Overall though, it's one of the most engaging idle games I've played, and I keep coming back to check on my kingdom's defenses!</p>
