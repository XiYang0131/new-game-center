                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Use WASD keys to move your character, and the mouse to aim. Left-click to fire your weapon, right-click to aim down sights for improved accuracy. Press Space to jump, Shift to sprint, and R to reload. The number keys (1-9) or scroll wheel can be used to switch between weapons in your loadout. Press Tab to view the scoreboard during matches. Each game mode has different objectives - in Team Deathmatch, work with your team to eliminate opponents; in Free-for-All, it's every player for themselves; in Capture the Flag, secure the enemy flag while protecting your own. Pay attention to the mini-map to track objectives and teammate positions. Experiment with different weapons and attachments to find combinations that suit your playstyle. Use the environment for cover and strategic positioning. Remember that headshots deal increased damage, so aim carefully. As you play and earn experience, you'll unlock new weapons, attachments, and customization options to expand your arsenal. Communication with teammates is key to success in team-based modes - coordinate your attacks and defenses for maximum effectiveness!</p>

                            <p>Skillwarz has quickly become my go-to FPS game! The gunplay feels incredibly satisfying - each weapon has a distinct feel and recoil pattern that rewards mastery. I particularly enjoy the map design; there's a perfect balance between open areas for sniping and tight corridors for close-quarters combat. The progression system keeps me coming back, as there's always a new attachment or weapon variant to unlock. For new players, I recommend starting with the assault rifles as they're versatile for most situations. The Desert Storm map is my favorite - lots of elevation changes and flanking routes that make for dynamic gameplay. Team Deathmatch is great for learning the basics, but Capture the Flag is where the game truly shines, requiring actual teamwork and strategy. The community is generally helpful to newcomers, though like any competitive game, you'll encounter the occasional trash-talker. Performance-wise, the game runs smoothly even on my older laptop, which is impressive given the visual quality. If you're looking for a skill-based FPS that doesn't require a massive download, Skillwarz is definitely worth checking out!</p>

                            <p>After hundreds of hours in Skillwarz, I can confidently say it's one of the most balanced FPS games I've played. What sets it apart from other browser shooters is the attention to detail in weapon mechanics and movement. The slight momentum in player movement prevents the bunny-hopping issues that plague similar games, while still allowing for skilled players to use mobility tactically. I've found that the SMGs are underrated - with the right attachments, they can dominate in most mid-range engagements while still being effective up close. The recent update that added the new Factory map has been fantastic for competitive play, with multiple paths to objectives and well-placed power positions that can be countered. One tip for improving quickly: spend some time in the shooting range mode to get comfortable with different weapons before jumping into matches. Also, adjust your mouse sensitivity - finding the right setting made a huge difference in my accuracy. The ranking system is fair and matches are generally balanced, though occasionally you'll face a team of coordinated players that will absolutely demolish you. Those matches, while frustrating, have taught me the most about improving my gameplay. Overall, Skillwarz strikes the perfect balance between accessibility and depth!</p>
