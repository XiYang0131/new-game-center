                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Use WASD or arrow keys to move your character around the map. Left-click to interact with objects, gather resources, or attack. Right-click to use special abilities or place structures. Press E to open your inventory and crafting menu. Drag and drop items in your inventory to equip them or combine them for crafting. Start by gathering basic resources like wood and stone by clicking on trees and rocks. Use these materials to craft your first tools, which will help you gather resources more efficiently. As you collect more advanced materials, you'll be able to craft better weapons and armor to protect yourself. Keep an eye on your hunger and health meters - you'll need to find food regularly to survive. Other players are your main threat - approach encounters cautiously and be prepared to fight or flee. Building a base can provide protection and a place to store your resources, but it also makes your position known to others. The safe zone shrinks over time, forcing players closer together and creating more intense encounters. If you die, you'll lose all your items and have to start over, so play strategically and don't take unnecessary risks. Form alliances with other players when beneficial, but remember that there can only be one ultimate survivor.</p>

                            <p>This game has completely taken over my free time! The balance between gathering resources, crafting, and PvP combat is perfect. I love how you can choose different playstyles - you can be aggressive and hunt other players, or take a more stealthy approach and focus on survival. The crafting system is deep enough to be interesting without being overwhelming. My favorite strategy is to quickly craft a bow and arrows, then hunt from a distance. The desert biome has the best resources if you can survive the lack of food and water. Pro tip: always craft a sleeping bag as soon as possible so you have a respawn point if you die. Looking forward to the rumored new biome in the next update!</p>

                            <p>I was skeptical about another survival game, but Lurkers.io really stands out with its smooth gameplay and quick pacing. Unlike other survival games that can drag on for hours, matches here are the perfect length - long enough to feel rewarding when you succeed, but short enough that losing doesn't feel too punishing. The controls are intuitive and responsive, which is crucial in tense combat situations. I appreciate that there's a tutorial for beginners - it helped me get up to speed quickly. The community is generally friendly, and I've had some great cooperative experiences with random players. That said, trust no one completely - I've been betrayed more than once by "allies" once I've gathered valuable resources!</p>

                            <p>As someone who's played many battle royale and survival games, I find Lurkers.io refreshingly strategic. The resource management adds a layer of depth that's missing from pure combat-focused games. I've found that the early game is all about efficiency - knowing exactly what resources to prioritize and what to craft first makes a huge difference. The metal armor might seem like the best choice, but I've found that leather armor with its mobility bonus is actually better in most situations. The night cycle is genuinely tense - the reduced visibility and increased monster spawns create some truly heart-pounding moments. My only suggestion would be to add more variety to the base building options. For new players: don't neglect food and water! I see so many newcomers die not from combat but from basic survival needs. Overall, it's one of the most addictive .io games I've played.</p>
