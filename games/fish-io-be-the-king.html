                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Use your mouse to control your fish's movement - your fish will follow the cursor. Alternatively, you can use WASD or arrow keys for movement. Consume the small food particles scattered throughout the ocean to grow gradually. As you grow larger, you'll be able to eat smaller fish, including other players who are smaller than you. Avoid larger fish and players, as they can eat you and end your run. Press the spacebar or left mouse button to activate a speed boost, which can help you catch prey or escape from predators. Be careful with your boost usage, as it depletes your energy which regenerates slowly over time. Collect special power-ups that appear randomly in the ocean - these can provide temporary abilities like increased speed, shield protection, or size boosts. The larger you grow, the slower your movement becomes, so use strategy when deciding whether to continue growing or maintain a more agile size. Some areas of the map contain more food but also more predators - decide whether the risk is worth the reward. Keep an eye on the leaderboard to see your ranking and identify potential threats from top players. If you're eaten, you'll respawn as a small fish and need to grow again. The goal is to reach the top of the leaderboard and maintain your position as the king of the ocean for as long as possible.</p>

                            <p>This game is incredibly addictive! I've spent hours trying to reach the top of the leaderboard. The balance between risk and reward is perfect - do you go after that slightly larger fish for a big size boost, or play it safe and stick to eating the small fry? I've found that the Shark fish type is great for aggressive play, while the Angelfish is better for a more cautious approach with its better maneuverability. The reef area in the center of the map has the most food, but it's also where most of the action happens, so be prepared for some intense battles! My best strategy has been to hang around the edges of busy areas and pick off damaged fish that are fleeing from larger predators. I reached #1 on the leaderboard yesterday and managed to hold the position for almost 10 minutes before a coordinated attack from several medium-sized fish took me down. Can't wait to try again!</p>

                            <p>I love how accessible this game is! The controls are simple enough that I could jump right in, but there's enough depth to keep me engaged for long play sessions. The visual design is bright and appealing, making it easy to distinguish between different fish sizes and types. I appreciate that even when you're small, you can still have an impact on the game by stealing food from larger players or teaming up with others to take down a big threat. The power-ups add a nice element of surprise and can really turn the tide of a battle. My favorite is the shield, which has saved me countless times from being someone else's lunch! One suggestion for the developers would be to add more environmental features that could be used strategically, like currents that speed up movement or caves where smaller fish could hide. Overall, it's a great game that I keep coming back to when I have a few minutes to spare.</p>

                            <p>As someone who enjoys analyzing game mechanics, I find Fish.io to be surprisingly deep. The size-based hierarchy creates an interesting ecosystem where players naturally fall into different roles based on their current size. Small fish focus on evasion and opportunistic feeding, mid-sized fish engage in tactical hunting of smaller players, and the largest fish become targets for everyone else, creating a natural balancing mechanism. I've noticed that the most successful players aren't necessarily those who grow the largest the fastest, but those who understand when to be aggressive and when to be cautious. The boost mechanic adds a crucial layer of decision-making - using it at the wrong time can leave you vulnerable, but a well-timed boost can secure a kill or save your life. For new players: don't underestimate the importance of the small food particles, especially early on. They're safer to collect than trying to eat other players and provide a consistent growth path. Also, learn to use the edge of the screen strategically - larger predators have a harder time maneuvering in tight spaces.</p>
