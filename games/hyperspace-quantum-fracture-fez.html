                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Hyperspace - Quantum Fracture FEZ features intuitive controls that allow you to navigate its complex dimensional spaces. Use the WASD keys or arrow keys to move your character through the environment. The core mechanic of the game is the ability to rotate the world around you - press Q and E (or left and right arrow keys while holding Shift) to rotate the world 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise. This rotation changes your perspective of the 3D world, revealing new paths and solutions that weren't visible from your previous viewpoint. What appears as a gap from one angle might be a connected platform from another. The spacebar allows your character to jump, which is essential for navigating platforms. In some areas, you'll encounter special abilities: the F key activates gravity manipulation, allowing you to walk on walls or ceilings in certain zones; the R key interacts with dimensional portals that transport you to parallel versions of the current area; and the T key activates time dilation, slowing down moving objects or platforms to help you navigate tricky sequences. Throughout the game, you'll collect glowing cubes called "Quantum Fragments" that are scattered across the environments. These fragments are not only collectibles but also keys to unlocking new areas and abilities. Some fragments are hidden in secret areas that require clever use of perspective shifts to discover. The game is divided into several distinct zones, each with its own visual theme and puzzle mechanics. As you progress, the puzzles become more complex, often requiring you to combine multiple mechanics to find solutions. Pay close attention to environmental cues - patterns, colors, and symbols in the environment often provide hints for solving puzzles. The game also features a map system that you can access by pressing M, helping you track your progress and identify unexplored areas. If you get stuck on a puzzle, try looking at it from different perspectives by rotating the world, or experiment with the various abilities at your disposal. Remember that in Hyperspace - Quantum Fracture FEZ, what you see depends entirely on your perspective, and the solution to a seemingly impossible puzzle might be just a rotation away.</p>

                            <p>Hyperspace - Quantum Fracture FEZ has completely blown my mind! The perspective-shifting mechanics are implemented so brilliantly that I found myself thinking in new ways about spatial relationships. The "Tesseract Zone" in particular had me staring at my screen for a good 20 minutes before I had that wonderful "aha!" moment when I realized I needed to think beyond traditional 3D space. What I appreciate most about this game is how it gradually introduces new mechanics, giving you time to master each one before combining them in increasingly complex puzzles. The visual design deserves special mention too - the way the environments fracture and reassemble during rotation transitions is not just visually stunning but also helps you understand the spatial relationships between different perspectives. For anyone struggling with the "Quantum Lock" puzzle in the third zone, pay close attention to the color patterns on the floor when viewed from different angles - they form a code that tells you the correct rotation sequence. My only minor criticism would be that some of the later time-dilation puzzles can be a bit finicky with timing, but the checkpoint system is generous enough that it never becomes frustrating. I've collected 42 of the 50 Quantum Fragments so far, and I'm determined to find them all to unlock the secret ending I've heard about. Easily one of the most innovative puzzle games I've played in years!</p>

                            <p>As someone who loves both puzzle games and theoretical physics, Hyperspace - Quantum Fracture FEZ is like a dream come true! The way it visualizes complex spatial concepts is not only fun but genuinely educational - I've actually found myself understanding some concepts from my physics classes better after playing. The difficulty curve is perfectly balanced; just when you think you've mastered a mechanic, the game introduces a clever twist that makes you reconsider everything you thought you knew. The "Möbius Strip" level in particular is a stroke of genius in how it plays with continuity and spatial looping. I've been taking my time with this game, often spending sessions just exploring the beautiful environments and hunting for hidden Quantum Fragments. The attention to detail in the world design is remarkable - I love how certain patterns and symbols recur throughout different zones, subtly hinting at the underlying narrative. Speaking of which, the story unfolds in such an organic way through environmental storytelling and collected fragments that piecing it together feels like its own meta-puzzle. For new players, my advice is to not rush - take time to experiment with different perspectives and really observe your surroundings. Sometimes the solution isn't about finding a hidden path but about seeing the existing space in a completely different way. Also, the soundtrack deserves special mention - the way it dynamically shifts with your rotations adds so much to the immersive experience. This game is a masterpiece of puzzle design that respects the player's intelligence while remaining accessible. Can't recommend it highly enough!</p>
