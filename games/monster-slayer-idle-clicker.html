                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Click on monsters to deal damage and defeat them. Each monster defeated will reward you with gold and experience points. Use gold to purchase upgrades for your hero, including better weapons, stronger armor, and new abilities. As you upgrade your hero, you'll be able to defeat monsters more quickly, earning gold at a faster rate. Your hero will also attack automatically, allowing for idle progression even when you're not actively clicking. Explore different monster zones as you grow stronger - each zone contains different types of monsters with varying difficulty levels and rewards. Defeat boss monsters for special rewards and to unlock new areas. Manage your upgrades strategically - some provide immediate benefits, while others may be more valuable in the long run. The game continues to progress even when you're not playing, so check back regularly to collect your offline earnings. As you reach higher levels, you'll unlock the prestige system, allowing you to reset your progress in exchange for permanent bonuses that make subsequent playthroughs faster and more rewarding. Experiment with different upgrade paths and strategies to optimize your gold earning potential and progress through the game more efficiently.</p>

                            <p>I've played a lot of idle clickers, and this one has a great balance between active play and idle progression. The upgrade system is deep enough to keep things interesting without being overwhelming. I particularly like how the different weapon types actually change your attack strategy rather than just being stat upgrades. The Forest zone was easy enough, but the difficulty spike in the Desert zone caught me off guard! For new players, I recommend focusing on DPS upgrades first, then critical hit chance, and finally critical damage multiplier. This progression seems to yield the best gold-per-minute in the early game. The prestige system is well-balanced too - I found that prestiging around level 100 gives the best return on time invested.</p>

                            <p>This game is perfect for my commute! I can actively play when I want to, but it also progresses while I'm busy. The graphics are charming and the sound effects are satisfying without being annoying. I appreciate that the offline progress is generous - some idle games barely give you anything when you're away, but this one feels fair. The boss designs are creative and actually require some strategy to defeat efficiently. My only suggestion would be to add more variety to the environments as you progress. After playing for a week, I've unlocked the Volcanic area, and the Fire Sword with its damage-over-time effect is definitely worth saving up for. Overall, it's a great time-killer that doesn't demand constant attention but rewards you when you do engage with it.</p>

                            <p>For those looking to optimize their progression, I've done some math on the upgrade efficiency. The "Gold Boost" skill is actually the most efficient purchase until about level 25, after which "Quick Hands" (attack speed) becomes better until level 50. After that, it depends on your weapon choice. For the Axe users, critical damage becomes most important, while Sword users should focus on attack speed, and Bow users benefit most from the "Eagle Eye" skill that increases critical hit chance. Don't waste gold on the "Health" upgrade unless you're struggling with bosses - offense is the best defense in this game since monsters don't fight back except for bosses. Also, the Ancient Amulet artifact that appears randomly is ALWAYS worth purchasing, regardless of its cost - it provides a permanent multiplier to all damage that persists through prestiges. I'm on my fifth prestige now, and the game still feels fresh with new challenges and strategies to explore.</p>
