                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Playing Elemental Merge is simple to learn but offers depth as you progress. You start with a few basic elements displayed at the bottom of your screen. To combine elements, simply drag one element onto another. If the combination produces a new element, it will appear on your board with a satisfying animation. If the combination doesn't work, the elements will bounce apart, indicating you should try different combinations. Your discovered elements are stored in your collection, which you can access at any time to see your progress and reuse previously created elements. The game board has limited space, so you'll need to manage your elements wisely. You can remove unwanted elements by dragging them to the trash bin icon. As you discover more complex elements, some combinations will require three or more elements to be combined in a specific sequence. Pay attention to the logical relationships between elements - for example, combining "water" and "earth" might create "mud," which could then be combined with other elements to create more complex items. If you get stuck, you can use the hint system by clicking the lightbulb icon, which will suggest possible combinations to try. The game saves your progress automatically, so you can continue your elemental discoveries across multiple play sessions. Challenge yourself to complete the entire collection of elements, and see if you can unlock the special secret combinations that lead to rare and unique creations!</p>

                            <p>I've been absolutely obsessed with Elemental Merge for the past week! The "aha!" moment when you discover a new combination is incredibly satisfying. I've managed to unlock about 187 elements so far, and I'm particularly proud of discovering the "rainbow" element which required a pretty complex chain of combinations. For anyone who's struggling to make progress, I found it helpful to think about real-world relationships between elements - many combinations follow logical patterns from nature or chemistry. The "technology" branch of elements has been the most challenging for me to complete, as some of the combinations aren't as intuitive. One small tip: don't forget that you can combine identical elements sometimes! Putting two "fire" elements together creates "energy," which opens up a whole new branch of discoveries. The only feature I wish the game had is a way to see which elements you've already tried combining, as I sometimes find myself repeating unsuccessful combinations. Overall though, this is one of the most engaging puzzle games I've played in ages - perfect for when you want something relaxing but still mentally stimulating!</p>

                            <p>Elemental Merge strikes the perfect balance between being accessible and challenging. I appreciate how the game starts simply but gradually introduces more complex combinations that require real thought and experimentation. The artwork is beautiful too - each new element has a distinct, colorful design that makes expanding your collection visually rewarding. I've been playing for about two weeks and have discovered around 230 elements so far. The "mythical creatures" branch was particularly fun to unlock - combining the basic elements to eventually create dragons, phoenixes, and other legendary beings felt like a real achievement. I've found that organizing my workspace is crucial for efficient discovery - I keep my most versatile elements (like life, death, energy, and time) in one corner for easy access, while using the rest of the space for experimentation. The hint system is well-implemented too, providing just enough guidance without spoiling the satisfaction of discovery. If you're completely stuck, try combining elements from completely different categories - some of the most interesting combinations come from mixing elements that seem unrelated. My only suggestion would be to add a search function for the collection screen, as scrolling through hundreds of elements can get cumbersome. This game has definitely earned its place as my go-to relaxation activity!</p>
