                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Use the WASD or arrow keys to control your vehicle. W/Up Arrow accelerates, S/Down Arrow reverses, A/Left Arrow and D/Right Arrow steer left and right respectively. Press Space to activate a temporary speed boost when available. The goal varies depending on the game mode - in Last Man Standing, you must be the last vehicle still operational by destroying all opponents. In Time Attack, score points by damaging opponents within the time limit. Target the weak points of enemy vehicles for maximum damage - hitting the sides or rear typically causes more damage than head-on collisions. Use the environment to your advantage - some arenas have hazards that can help you eliminate opponents. Collect power-ups that appear in the arena for temporary advantages like extra speed, increased damage, or vehicle repairs. Manage your vehicle's condition - excessive damage will eventually lead to destruction. As you progress and earn currency, upgrade your vehicles to improve speed, handling, durability, and damage output. Different vehicles have different strengths - some are fast but fragile, while others are slower but can take and deal more damage. Experiment with different vehicles and find the one that suits your playstyle. Remember that sometimes strategic retreats are necessary to let your opponents damage each other before you swoop in for the final blow.</p>

                            <p>This game is pure chaotic fun! I love how satisfying the crashes feel - the physics engine does a great job of making each collision feel impactful. The Monster Truck is definitely my favorite vehicle once you unlock it - it can plow through almost anything, though it's a bit slow to maneuver. The Desert Arena is probably the most challenging map because of all the ramps and pitfalls, but that makes victories there all the sweeter. For beginners, I recommend focusing on upgrading durability first, then damage output. Speed upgrades are tempting, but being able to survive longer in the arena is more important. Also, don't waste your boost on straight driving - save it for when you're about to make contact with an opponent for maximum damage!</p>

                            <p>I wasn't expecting much from this game at first, but I've found myself coming back to it again and again. There's something incredibly satisfying about smashing into other cars and watching the parts fly! The controls are simple enough that anyone can pick it up, but there's definitely skill involved in timing your attacks and positioning. I appreciate that the early levels are forgiving enough for newcomers, but the difficulty ramps up at a good pace to keep things interesting. The variety of vehicles keeps the gameplay fresh - each one feels distinct and requires slightly different tactics. My only suggestion would be to add a multiplayer mode in a future update - competing against friends would take this game to the next level. Overall, it's a great stress-reliever when you just want to cause some vehicular mayhem!</p>

                            <p>As someone who appreciates good physics in games, I'm impressed by how well the vehicle damage and collision mechanics work in Madness Car Destroy. The way different parts of the cars deform based on impact direction and force feels realistic without being overly complex. I've found that the Sports Car with full handling upgrades is actually the most effective vehicle for me - the ability to quickly maneuver and target specific opponents outweighs the durability benefits of heavier vehicles. The Stadium Arena with its cross-shaped layout creates the most interesting tactical situations, as you can use the central intersection to create multi-car pileups. One advanced technique that took me a while to master is the "spin hit" - accelerate, then quickly reverse while turning to spin your vehicle. Time it right, and you can hit opponents with the side of your car while distributing the impact force, minimizing damage to yourself while maximizing damage to them. Looking forward to seeing what new vehicles and arenas might be added in future updates!</p>
