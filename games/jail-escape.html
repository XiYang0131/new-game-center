                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Jail Escape features intuitive point-and-click controls that make the game accessible while still offering depth and challenge. To interact with the environment, simply click on objects or areas of interest. The cursor will change to indicate when interaction is possible. Your inventory is displayed at the bottom of the screen, and you can select items by clicking on them, then click again on the environment to use them. Right-clicking on inventory items examines them more closely, sometimes revealing hidden features or uses. The game begins with a tutorial sequence that introduces the basic mechanics and prison layout. Your primary objective is to plan and execute your escape, but this will require completing numerous smaller tasks and solving interconnected puzzles. Observation is key in Jail Escape. Pay close attention to guard movements, which follow patterns but can change based on events or time of day. The clock in the corner shows the current time, and different prison activities occur at scheduled intervals. These routines create opportunities for exploration or gathering resources. Building relationships with other inmates is crucial for success. Talk to everyone you can by clicking on them, and remember their information and personalities. Some prisoners can become valuable allies who provide items, information, or distractions, while others might betray your plans if you're not careful. Resource management plays an important role in the game. Your character has basic needs like hunger and energy that must be maintained. Neglecting these needs can limit your abilities or create additional challenges. The crafting system allows you to combine inventory items to create tools essential for your escape. Experiment with different combinations, and remember that many ordinary objects can serve multiple purposes in the right situation. The game features a stealth system where your visibility to guards is indicated by an eye icon. Stay in shadows, move slowly when guards are nearby, and use distractions to avoid detection. Being caught doesn't always end the game but will result in increased security and potentially lost items. For beginners, focus first on learning the prison layout and routines before attempting major escape activities. Take notes on guard patterns, locked areas, and potential weaknesses in security. The game rewards patience and planning rather than rushed actions. Remember that there are multiple valid approaches to escaping, from patient tunneling to elaborate social engineering or high-risk confrontation. Your choices throughout the game will influence which options become available, so consider your strategy carefully. The hint system can provide guidance if you get stuck, but using it sparingly will result in a more satisfying experience as you solve the prison's puzzles on your own terms.</p>

                            <p>I've played a lot of escape room games, but Jail Escape really stands out for its attention to detail and the way it creates genuine tension. The guard AI is impressively realistic - they don't just follow fixed patterns but seem to adapt to situations in a way that keeps you on your toes. I found myself actually holding my breath during close calls! The crafting system is another highlight - it's intuitive but still challenging, and I love how many different ways you can repurpose everyday prison items. I've discovered at least three completely different escape methods so far, and I'm sure there are more. The laundry room route was particularly clever with how it used the scheduling system. For players who are struggling with the first major obstacle (getting past the cell block guard), try paying attention to his coffee breaks and the maintenance schedule - there's a perfect window of opportunity if you time it right. The relationship system with other inmates adds another layer of strategy too. I initially tried to befriend everyone, but quickly learned that some alliances come with strings attached, and certain inmates don't get along with others. Choosing your friends carefully makes a big difference in later stages. The difficulty curve is well-balanced too - it starts relatively simple but gradually introduces more complex systems as you explore further into the prison. The workshop area puzzle chain was my favorite, especially how it integrated with the electrical system throughout the facility. If I had one criticism, it would be that the inventory management can get a bit cumbersome in the later game when you're juggling lots of items, but that's a minor issue in an otherwise excellent game. I'm already on my third playthrough trying to find all the possible endings!</p>

                            <p>Jail Escape offers a refreshing take on the escape room genre by creating a living, breathing prison environment rather than just a series of disconnected puzzles. The day/night cycle and prison routine mechanics create a dynamic playground that feels realistic while still being fun to interact with. I particularly appreciate how the game respects player intelligence - solutions make logical sense within the game world, and there are multiple ways to overcome most obstacles. The hint system is there if you need it, but it nudges you in the right direction rather than just giving away answers. The story deserves special mention too. What starts as a simple prison break evolves into a more complex narrative with interesting characters and moral choices. Your cellmate's backstory was unexpectedly moving, and I found myself genuinely caring about whether certain NPCs made it out with me. The game also does a great job of creating memorable set pieces - the cafeteria riot diversion and the guard tower sequence were particularly tense and satisfying to pull off successfully. For new players, don't overlook the importance of the prison schedule! I wasted a lot of time in my first playthrough trying to brute-force solutions during high-security periods when I could have just waited for a more opportune moment. Also, the library contains more useful information than might be immediately obvious - the books aren't just decoration. My only suggestion for improvement would be adding a bit more variety to the guard dialogue, as it gets repetitive during longer play sessions. Otherwise, this is easily one of the best puzzle-adventure games I've played this year, with enough content and alternate solutions to justify multiple playthroughs. The tunnel escape route was my personal favorite - the way you have to manage the dirt disposal and shore up the passage feels like a mini-game in itself.</p>
