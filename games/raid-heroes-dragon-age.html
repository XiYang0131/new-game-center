                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Begin your adventure by selecting your starting heroes from different classes - Warriors provide frontline protection, Mages deal area damage, Rogues excel at single-target damage, and Healers keep your team alive. As you progress through the tutorial, you'll learn the basics of combat, which takes place on a grid-based battlefield. During combat, heroes take turns based on their speed stat. When it's a hero's turn, you can move them on the grid and use one of their abilities. Position is crucial - some abilities affect specific areas, and heroes receive bonuses for attacking from certain positions (like rogues dealing more damage from behind enemies). Each hero has unique abilities that consume mana, as well as a basic attack that doesn't require mana. Heroes gain experience from battles, leveling up to increase their stats and unlock new abilities. Collect gear from defeated enemies and completed quests to equip your heroes, enhancing their stats and sometimes providing special effects. As you progress, you'll unlock the ability to upgrade gear, enhance abilities, and even evolve your heroes to more powerful forms. The main campaign follows your quest to defeat increasingly powerful dragons, with side quests offering additional rewards and story content. For challenging content, form a balanced team that includes tanks to absorb damage, damage dealers to eliminate enemies, and support characters to heal and buff your team. Remember that different enemies have various resistances and vulnerabilities - adapt your strategy accordingly. The game also features a guild system where you can join other players, participate in guild raids, and earn exclusive rewards.</p>

                            <p>Raid Heroes: Dragon Age has completely exceeded my expectations for a browser-based RPG! The depth of the combat system is impressive - positioning your heroes correctly and timing your abilities makes a huge difference in difficult battles. I've been playing for about three weeks now and have collected 18 different heroes. My current favorite team composition is Valorn (tank), Lyra (healer), Thorne (archer), and Ignis (fire mage). This setup gives me good survivability while still having enough damage output to handle most encounters. The Crimson Drake boss on level 24 was particularly challenging until I realized you need to focus on taking out his healing crystals first. For new players, I highly recommend prioritizing the "Hero Academy" upgrade early on, as it significantly increases your heroes' experience gain. Also, save your premium currency for the guaranteed legendary hero summons rather than spending it on random pulls. The storyline has some genuinely interesting twists, especially when you reach the ancient temple area. Can't wait to see what new content they add in future updates!</p>

                            <p>As someone who loves tactical RPGs, I found Raid Heroes: Dragon Age to be a real gem. The grid-based combat system reminds me of classics like Final Fantasy Tactics, but with its own unique mechanics. The synergy between different hero abilities creates interesting strategic options - for example, using the ice mage to freeze enemies in place and then having your warrior use area attacks for maximum damage. I appreciate that the game is quite generous with resources for free players, though progress does slow down in the later stages. The gear system adds another layer of strategy, especially with the set bonuses that can completely change how a character functions. My advice for mid-game players is to focus on fully upgrading a core team of 6-8 heroes rather than spreading your resources too thin across many characters. The Dragon Trials mode that unlocks at level 30 offers some of the best rewards in the game but requires carefully tailored teams for each challenge. My only criticism would be that some of the later story missions feel a bit grindy, requiring multiple attempts even with well-equipped heroes. Overall though, it's one of the most engaging browser RPGs I've played in years!</p>
