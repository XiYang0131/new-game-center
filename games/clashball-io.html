                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>ClashBall.io features intuitive controls that are easy to pick up. Use the WASD keys or arrow keys to move your ball around the arena. The longer you hold a direction key, the faster your ball will roll in that direction, allowing you to build up momentum for powerful collisions. Press the Spacebar to jump, which is useful for avoiding obstacles or other players' attacks. Your primary objective is to knock other players off the edge of the platform while staying on it yourself. The last ball remaining on the platform wins the round. Throughout each match, various power-ups will spawn on the platform. Roll over them to collect and activate their effects: Red power-ups increase your size and knockback force, making it easier to push other players. Blue power-ups boost your speed, helping you evade opponents or quickly reach strategic positions. Yellow power-ups provide a temporary shield that protects you from being knocked back. Green power-ups give you a jump boost, allowing you to leap higher and farther. The arena itself presents various challenges - some platforms may have moving sections, slippery surfaces, or obstacles that can help or hinder your movement. As matches progress, the platform may gradually shrink, forcing players into closer confrontation. Strategic positioning is key - try to stay near the center of the platform when possible and be aware of your surroundings. Use the momentum of your ball to your advantage by building up speed before colliding with opponents. Watch how other players move and try to predict their actions. Sometimes it's better to let opponents fight each other while you stay safe. As you play matches and knock out opponents, you'll earn points that can be used to unlock customization options for your ball in the main menu. These are cosmetic only and don't affect gameplay, but they're a fun way to show off your achievements.</p>

                            <p>ClashBall.io has quickly become my go-to game during lunch breaks! The matches are quick enough that you can fit several in a short time, but each one is packed with action and excitement. I've found that mastering the momentum mechanics is key to success - building up speed before hitting opponents gives you much more knockback power. The Volcano arena is definitely my favorite with its moving platforms and lava hazards that add an extra layer of challenge. For new players, I recommend focusing on power-up collection early in the match rather than immediately going for knockouts. The speed power-ups in particular can save you in tight situations. I've also noticed that many players underestimate the importance of the jump ability - a well-timed jump can not only save you from being knocked off but can also be used offensively to land on top of opponents for a surprise attack. My current high score is 7 consecutive wins, which earned me enough points to unlock the Galaxy skin. The only minor issue I've encountered is occasional lag when there are many players with elaborate skins, but it's not enough to detract from the fun. Definitely worth playing if you enjoy competitive multiplayer games!</p>

                            <p>This game perfectly captures what makes .io games so addictive - simple concept, easy to learn controls, but with enough depth to keep you engaged for hours. The physics feel just right - weighty enough that collisions are satisfying, but responsive enough that you never feel like you're fighting the controls. I love the strategic elements that emerge naturally during gameplay. Sometimes it's better to hang back and let others fight while you collect power-ups, other times you need to aggressively pursue knockouts before someone else gets too powerful. The different arenas each require slightly different approaches too. In the Ice arena, I've found that patience is key since it's so easy to slide off accidentally. For the Factory arena with its moving conveyor belts, using the belts to gain extra speed can give you a huge advantage if timed correctly. The progression system keeps me coming back - I'm currently saving up for the Flame trail effect which looks amazing. One tip for beginners: don't neglect defense! Many new players focus solely on knocking others off and end up being easy targets themselves. Learning when to retreat and reposition is just as important as landing big hits. My only suggestion for improvement would be adding some kind of team mode for playing with friends. Overall though, it's one of the most polished .io games I've played!</p>
