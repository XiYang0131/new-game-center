                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Use your mouse to interact with the game world. Click on objects or areas to use your godly powers on them. Different powers will be available depending on the level and your progression in the game. These might include creating rain, growing plants, moving objects, or influencing your cat followers. Pay attention to the environment and the needs of your followers - they'll often provide clues about what needs to be done. Each level has specific objectives that must be completed to progress, such as helping cats reach certain areas, gathering resources, or solving environmental puzzles. As you advance, you'll unlock new divine abilities that expand your puzzle-solving options. Experiment with combining different powers to discover creative solutions. If you get stuck, look for subtle hints in the environment or the behavior of your followers. Remember that as a god, your perspective is different - sometimes viewing the entire scene rather than focusing on individual elements can reveal the solution. Be patient and think creatively - the path to godhood is paved with clever puzzles!</p>

                            <p>Law of the Cat God is absolutely purr-fect! The puzzle design is clever without being frustratingly difficult, striking that ideal balance where solving each challenge feels rewarding. I love how the game gradually introduces new divine powers, giving you time to understand each one before combining them in more complex situations. The art style is adorable - the little cat followers with their various personalities and reactions to your godly interventions never fail to make me smile. The weather manipulation puzzles in the third chapter were particularly creative, requiring you to think about the chain reactions your powers would cause. For anyone struggling with the temple puzzle in chapter 4, remember that timing is crucial - you need to coordinate the movements of multiple followers. I appreciate how the game doesn't punish experimentation; you can try different approaches without harsh penalties. The humorous writing and cat puns throughout the narrative add another layer of charm to an already delightful game. Highly recommended for puzzle lovers and cat enthusiasts alike!</p>

                            <p>This game combines two of my favorite things: clever puzzles and cats! The premise is unique and executed wonderfully - playing as a deity who must help their feline followers provides both an interesting gameplay mechanic and a cute narrative framework. I particularly enjoyed how the puzzles require you to think from a god's perspective, considering how your actions will affect the entire environment rather than just direct interactions. The difficulty curve is well-designed, starting with simple cause-and-effect puzzles before building to more complex scenarios that require combining multiple powers in creative ways. The sunset level where you need to manipulate shadows was especially memorable and innovative. The developers clearly put thought into making each puzzle feel distinct rather than repetitive. I also appreciate the multiple endings based on your divine approach - my first playthrough I went for the benevolent cat god route, but I'm curious to try the more chaotic path next time. The soothing soundtrack perfectly complements the gameplay, making this a relaxing yet engaging puzzle experience. If you enjoy thoughtful puzzles with charming presentation, this game is definitely worth your time!</p>
