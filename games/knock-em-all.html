                <h2>About Knock Em All</h2>
                <p>Knock Em All is an addictive physics-based arcade game that challenges your aim, timing, and spatial reasoning. Your objective is simple but engaging: knock down all the targets on each level using a limited number of balls. As you progress through the game, you'll encounter increasingly complex arrangements of targets, obstacles, and physics-based challenges that require creative thinking and precise execution. With colorful graphics, satisfying physics, and a perfect balance of casual fun and strategic depth, Knock Em All offers an entertaining experience that's easy to learn but difficult to master.</p>

                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Click and drag to aim your ball, then release to shoot. The longer you drag, the more power you'll put into your shot. Your goal is to knock down all the targets on the screen using the limited number of balls provided for each level. Different targets have different properties - some are heavier and require more force to move, while others are lighter and more easily knocked over. Pay attention to the physics of each level and plan your shots carefully to create chain reactions that can knock down multiple targets at once. Some levels feature special elements like trampolines, moving platforms, or explosive objects that can help you clear targets more efficiently. As you progress, you'll unlock special balls with unique abilities, such as splitting into multiple balls, having increased weight, or bouncing more. Use these special abilities strategically to overcome particularly challenging levels. If you run out of balls before clearing all targets, you'll need to restart the level. Try to complete each level using as few balls as possible to earn a higher star rating. Remember that sometimes the solution requires thinking outside the box - the most direct approach isn't always the most effective.</p>

                            <p>This game is deceptively simple but incredibly addictive! I love how it teaches you about physics and angles without feeling like an educational game. The chain reactions you can create are so satisfying, especially when you knock down a complex arrangement with just one well-placed shot. Level 24 was particularly challenging with those rotating platforms - took me about 15 attempts to figure out the timing. The split ball power-up is a game-changer for the later levels. My only suggestion would be to add a level editor so players could create and share their own challenges.</p>

                            <p>This is the perfect game to play with kids! My 8-year-old and I take turns trying to solve each level, and it's been a great way to teach him about cause and effect, angles, and problem-solving. The difficulty progression is well-balanced - it introduces new concepts gradually so you never feel overwhelmed. We particularly enjoy the levels with the explosive targets that can set off chain reactions. The sound effects and visual feedback when you knock everything down are really satisfying. It's become our go-to game for quick play sessions when we have a few minutes to spare.</p>

                            <p>As someone who's played a lot of physics-based games, I can say this is one of the better ones out there. The physics feel realistic and consistent, which is crucial for this type of game. I appreciate that there's often multiple ways to solve each level - you can go for the direct approach or find clever ways to use the environment to your advantage. The three-star rating system adds good replay value as I find myself going back to earlier levels to improve my score. Pro tip: for levels with multiple platforms, try to create a domino effect by knocking the highest platform first. Looking forward to seeing if they add more levels in future updates!</p>
