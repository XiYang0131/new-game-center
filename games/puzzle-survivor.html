                <h2>Game Description</h2>
                <p>Puzzle Survivor is an innovative game that brilliantly combines match-3 puzzle mechanics with survival strategy elements. In this challenging adventure, you'll need to match tiles to gather essential resources like food, wood, and stone, which you'll use to craft weapons, build shelters, and defend yourself against waves of increasingly dangerous enemies. As day turns to night, the threats grow more menacing, forcing you to plan your matches strategically to ensure your survival. With its unique blend of casual puzzle gameplay and deeper survival mechanics, Puzzle Survivor offers a fresh and engaging experience that will test both your pattern recognition skills and your strategic thinking.</p>

                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>The core gameplay of Puzzle Survivor revolves around matching three or more identical tiles on the game board by swapping adjacent pieces. Different tiles represent various resources: green for food (restores health), brown for wood (used for crafting), gray for stone (used for building), and blue for water (increases energy). Match these resources strategically based on your current needs. During the day phase, focus on gathering as many resources as possible and crafting essential items. Access your inventory by clicking the backpack icon to see what you've collected and what you can craft. The crafting menu allows you to create weapons, tools, and shelter components using the resources you've gathered. As night approaches (indicated by the day/night meter at the top of the screen), prepare your defenses and equip your best weapons. During the night phase, enemies will appear around the edges of the board. Match weapon tiles (red) to attack these enemies before they can damage you. Your health is displayed at the top of the screen - if it reaches zero, the game is over. As you progress, you'll unlock new tile types, crafting recipes, and face more challenging enemies. Remember that planning ahead is crucial - certain matches can create special combo tiles that clear entire rows or areas, which can be lifesaving during difficult night phases. Use your resources wisely and adapt your strategy based on what resources are available on the board.</p>

                            <p>Puzzle Survivor is such a refreshing take on the match-3 genre! I love how it adds meaningful strategy to what could otherwise be a simple puzzle game. The day/night cycle creates a great sense of urgency - during my first few games, I wasn't prepared for how quickly night falls and got overwhelmed by enemies. Now I make sure to prioritize weapon crafting early on. The Ranger class has been my favorite so far because of the bonus to ranged attacks, which helps keep enemies at bay. One tip for new players: try to set up potential matches of 4 or 5 tiles before night falls, then trigger them when enemies appear for maximum damage. The special tiles you get from larger matches are absolutely crucial for surviving later nights. My only suggestion would be to add more variety to the enemy types, but otherwise, this is one of the most engaging puzzle games I've played in a long time!</p>

                            <p>This game has completely hooked me with its clever combination of mechanics! As someone who enjoys both puzzle games and survival games, Puzzle Survivor feels like it was made specifically for me. The resource management aspect adds a layer of depth that keeps me engaged far longer than regular match-3 games. I've found that balancing your resource gathering is key - it's tempting to focus only on weapons, but you'll quickly run out of health without food matches. The crafting system is intuitive and satisfying, especially when you create your first advanced weapon and see how much more effective it is against the tougher night enemies. For those struggling with the later nights, try crafting the shield item as soon as possible - it reduces damage significantly and gives you more time to clear the board of enemies. My current record is surviving 7 nights, but I'm determined to beat that! Highly recommend giving this game a try if you want something more strategic than your average puzzle game.</p>
