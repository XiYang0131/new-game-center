                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Click or tap on different areas of your shop to perform actions. Serve customers by clicking on them to take their order, then click on the appropriate product to give it to them. Collect money by clicking on the cash register after serving a customer. Keep an eye on your inventory levels and restock when necessary by clicking on the storage area. Use your earnings to purchase upgrades for your shop, including better equipment, more inventory space, and decorations that attract more customers. Pay attention to customer satisfaction - if customers wait too long, they'll leave without making a purchase. Different customers have different patience levels, indicated by the timer above their heads. As you progress, you'll unlock new products to sell and new types of customers to serve. Manage your time efficiently, especially during rush hours when many customers arrive at once. Complete daily goals to earn bonus rewards that can help you expand your business faster. Remember that some upgrades increase your shop's popularity, bringing in more customers but also creating more pressure to serve them quickly. Find the right balance between expansion and maintaining quality service to maximize your profits.</p>

                            <p>This game is so adorable and surprisingly addictive! I love the cute panda character and all the different customers that come into the shop. The progression feels well-balanced - you can earn enough to make regular upgrades without it feeling too grindy. I found that prioritizing the speed upgrades early on makes a huge difference in handling the rush hours. The bamboo-themed decorations are my favorite for attracting the high-paying tourist customers. One tip for new players: don't neglect the storage upgrades - running out of inventory during a busy period can really hurt your profits. I've been playing for about a week and I'm still discovering new features as I level up my shop!</p>

                            <p>I've been playing this with my 7-year-old daughter and she absolutely loves it! The cute graphics immediately drew her in, but the gameplay is substantial enough to keep both of us engaged. It's been a great way to teach her some basic concepts about money management and customer service in a fun way. We take turns running the shop and seeing who can earn more in a day. The difficulty ramps up at a good pace - challenging enough to keep things interesting but not so hard that it becomes frustrating for younger players. My daughter's favorite part is decorating the shop with all the different items you can unlock. If the developers are reading this, we'd love to see more customization options in future updates!</p>

                            <p>As someone who enjoys business simulation games, I found Panda Shop Simulator to be a nice balance of casual fun and strategic thinking. The mechanics are simple enough to pick up quickly, but there's enough depth to keep you engaged as you optimize your shop layout and service flow. I appreciate that different products have different profit margins and preparation times, forcing you to make decisions about what to prioritize. The special events like the weekend rush or holiday themes add nice variety to the gameplay. My only suggestion would be to add more long-term goals or perhaps a campaign mode with specific challenges to overcome. For those struggling with the later levels, I found that the "Quick Paws" and "Friendly Service" upgrades combined make a huge difference in customer satisfaction. Overall, it's a charming little game that's perfect for short play sessions.</p>
