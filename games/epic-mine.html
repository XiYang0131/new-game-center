                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>In Epic Mine, your goal is to build and manage a successful mining operation. When you start the game, you'll be guided through a tutorial that explains the basic mechanics. The main interface shows your mining site with various sections: the mine shaft where extraction happens, the surface facilities for processing, and the management panel for business decisions. To begin mining, click on the rock layers in the mine shaft to extract resources. Each click represents a mining action, with better equipment allowing for more efficient extraction. As you collect resources, they'll appear in your inventory at the top of the screen. These can be sold directly for immediate profit or processed into more valuable forms using facilities you build. To upgrade your operation, click the "Upgrades" button in the management panel. Here you can purchase better mining equipment, hire additional workers, research new technologies, and construct processing facilities. Each upgrade requires specific resources and/or currency, so planning your development path is crucial. Workers can be assigned to different tasks by clicking on them and then selecting their job from the assignment menu. Different workers have varying skills that make them better suited for specific roles. The "Market" tab shows current prices for various resources, which fluctuate over time. Strategic selling when prices are high can significantly increase your profits. As you dig deeper, you'll encounter different geological layers with unique resources and challenges. Some areas may contain water that requires pumps to clear, unstable rock that needs support structures, or even hidden caves with rare minerals. The game features a depth meter on the side of the screen showing your current mining level and what might be found deeper. Special events occur randomly during gameplay, presenting opportunities or challenges that require quick decisions. These might include mineral rushes where certain resources temporarily increase in value, equipment malfunctions that need repair, or discoveries of ancient artifacts. With strategic resource management, efficient worker assignment, and smart upgrading decisions, you'll transform your small mining operation into a vast underground empire!</p>

                            <p>Epic Mine has completely taken over my free time for the past three weeks! The progression system is incredibly satisfying - there's always a new upgrade to work toward or a deeper level to explore. I've reached the Magma Layer at 2500m depth, and the rare minerals there are worth the challenge of managing the heat mechanics. For new players struggling with efficiency, here's a tip that helped me tremendously: focus on upgrading your conveyor systems before expanding horizontally. A fast transport network makes a huge difference in productivity, especially once you start processing ores. The worker specialization system is brilliantly implemented too. I've found that having dedicated teams for exploration, extraction, and maintenance creates the best workflow. My exploration team with high perception stats has discovered three hidden caverns so far, each with unique resources that aren't found in the main shaft. The market fluctuation system adds another layer of strategy - I've been stockpiling rubies for the past week waiting for the price to peak during the upcoming "Luxury Goods Boom" event. The archaeological discoveries are a fun surprise element - finding the ancient mining civilization artifacts unlocked a whole questline that provided both lore and valuable technology blueprints. My only minor criticism would be that the early game can feel a bit grindy before you get your first few major upgrades, but pushing through that initial phase is definitely worth it. If you enjoy resource management games with depth (pun intended!), Epic Mine offers one of the most comprehensive and rewarding experiences I've found in a browser game!</p>

                            <p>As someone with a background in geology, I'm genuinely impressed by the level of detail in Epic Mine's resource system! The way different minerals appear in realistic formations and depths shows the developers really did their research. I particularly appreciate how the game implements concepts like ore grade and impurities that affect processing efficiency - it's these small details that create a more engaging simulation. From a gameplay perspective, I've found that the most profitable approach is to focus on a balanced operation rather than specializing too early. My current setup uses a mix of automated and manual extraction, with processing facilities for each major resource type. The research system deserves special mention - the tech tree is extensive and each upgrade feels meaningful rather than just incremental stat boosts. The "Resonant Drilling" technology was a game-changer for me, allowing access to previously unreachable pockets of high-grade ore. The random events add nice variety to the gameplay loop - I particularly enjoyed the "Ancient Machinery" event where you can choose to restore old mining equipment for unique bonuses. For players hitting a wall around the 1000m mark, I recommend investing in structural reinforcement research before pushing deeper, as cave-ins become increasingly common and costly below that point. The community challenges are a great addition too - last week's "Diamond Rush" had everyone competing to extract the most diamonds in 24 hours, with the global leaderboard creating some friendly competition. The developers are also impressively responsive to feedback - they implemented the worker specialization system after community suggestions, which shows their commitment to improving the game. Overall, Epic Mine strikes that perfect balance between accessibility and depth that makes for a truly addictive simulation game.</p>
