                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Click on the "Heroes" tab to view and manage your available characters. Drag heroes from your roster to the formation grid to add them to your team. Each hero has unique abilities and stats that make them suitable for different roles such as tank, damage dealer, or support. Consider team synergies when building your lineup - certain combinations of heroes provide special bonuses. Visit the "Equipment" tab to manage your gear. Each piece of equipment provides different stat bonuses. Match the right equipment to each hero based on their role and abilities. In the "Skills" tab, you can upgrade and customize your heroes' abilities using skill points earned from battles. The "Formation" tab allows you to position your heroes strategically. Front-line positions are better for tanks, while back-line positions are safer for fragile damage dealers and healers. Once your team is ready, enter a battle by selecting a stage from the campaign map or entering the arena. During combat, your heroes will fight automatically based on their AI and positioning. After each battle, you'll earn rewards including experience, gold, and sometimes new equipment or heroes. Use these resources to strengthen your team for future challenges. As you progress, you'll unlock new features such as hero evolution, special abilities, and challenging game modes. Experiment with different team compositions to find effective strategies against various enemy types. Some enemies have specific weaknesses or immunities that require adapting your approach. For particularly challenging battles, consider using consumable items that provide temporary buffs to your team.</p>

                            <p>This game has incredible depth for an auto-battler! I've been playing for a few weeks now and I'm still discovering new team combinations and strategies. The key to success in the later stages is understanding the elemental system - fire beats nature, nature beats water, water beats fire, etc. Building teams that exploit enemy weaknesses makes a huge difference. My current favorite setup is a dual-tank frontline with the Paladin and Warrior, supported by an Elementalist and Priest in the back. The Paladin's defensive aura combined with the Priest's healing creates amazing survivability, while the Warrior and Elementalist provide consistent damage output. For anyone struggling with the Chapter 5 boss, try bringing heroes with stun abilities to interrupt its ultimate attack. Also, don't neglect equipment enhancement - even a few levels of upgrades can significantly boost your team's performance!</p>

                            <p>I love how this game balances accessibility with strategic depth. The auto-battle system means you don't need lightning-fast reflexes, but the team building and preparation aspects require genuine tactical thinking. The progression feels rewarding without being too grindy - I've been able to build a competitive team without spending hours farming resources. The art style is charming and each character has a distinct personality that comes through in their design and animations. My only suggestion would be to add more variety to the arena opponents, as you tend to see the same team compositions after a while. The recent update that added the Guild Raid feature was a great addition - coordinating with guildmates to take down powerful bosses adds a nice collaborative element to the game. For new players: focus on building a balanced team rather than just using your highest-rarity heroes. A well-synergized team of lower-rarity heroes will outperform a random collection of legendary characters!</p>

                            <p>As someone who doesn't usually have time for complex RPGs, this game is perfect! I can make meaningful progress in short play sessions, and the auto-battle system means I can multitask while grinding easier levels. The tutorial does a good job of explaining the basics, though I wish it went into more detail about some of the more advanced mechanics like combo effects and status resistances. I've found the Rogue to be surprisingly effective despite being an uncommon hero - her dodge chance and critical hit abilities make her a great damage dealer if you equip her with the right gear. The events are well-designed and offer good rewards without requiring an excessive time commitment. One tip for beginners: don't spend your premium currency on random hero summons right away. Save up for the guaranteed legendary hero packs that appear every month - they provide much better value. Overall, it's a great game that respects your time while still offering plenty of depth for those who want to dive deeper into the mechanics.</p>
