                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Use WASD or arrow keys to move your character. Press E to interact with objects and gather resources. Left-click to attack or use tools. Right-click to block with weapons or place building structures. Press the number keys (1-9) to select items from your hotbar. Open your inventory with Tab or I to manage your items and access the crafting menu. Start by gathering basic resources like wood from trees and stone from rocks. Craft basic tools to gather resources more efficiently. Build a simple shelter to protect yourself during the night and store your resources. Craft weapons to defend yourself against other players and hostile creatures. As you gather more advanced resources, you can craft better equipment and expand your base. Keep an eye on your hunger and health meters - you'll need to find or craft food to survive. Be cautious when encountering other players - they may be friendly or hostile. Consider forming alliances with other players for mutual protection and resource sharing. Explore different areas of the map to find rare resources and hidden treasures. Develop a strategy that suits your playstyle - you can focus on building, combat, exploration, or a balance of all three. Remember that death results in dropping your inventory, so store valuable items in secure containers at your base. The game world evolves as players interact with it - areas may become depleted of resources or turned into battlegrounds.</p>

                            <p>This game has completely taken over my gaming time! The balance between gathering, crafting, and combat is perfect. I love how the different biomes each have their own unique resources and challenges - the Desert region is brutal with its lack of water sources, but the rare minerals you can find there make it worth the risk. For new players, I recommend focusing on tool upgrades before weapons - being able to gather resources efficiently will give you a huge advantage in the long run. My current base is in the Mountain biome near a waterfall - it's a great defensive position with only one approach path that's easy to fortify. Our clan "Resource Raiders" has established a pretty successful trading post in the central region - if anyone wants to join forces or trade, look us up! The recent update that added the underground cave systems was a great addition - those crystal formations can be crafted into some of the most powerful weapons in the game. Just be prepared for the cave dwellers that guard them - they're no joke!</p>

                            <p>As someone who loves the building aspects of survival games, I'm impressed by the construction system in Craft and Battle. The snap-grid building makes creating complex structures intuitive, while still allowing for creative designs. I've spent more time building elaborate bases than actually fighting other players! My current project is a massive fortress with multiple defensive layers, trap corridors, and a central keep with all my crafting stations. The weather system adds a nice challenge to building - you need to consider how your structures will hold up during storms in different biomes. I've found that stone structures are essential in the Forest biome due to the frequent thunderstorms, while wood works fine in the drier regions. One tip for aspiring builders: always secure your resource storage first before working on aesthetics. Nothing worse than losing all your hard-earned materials to a raid while you're working on decorative elements! The community has been surprisingly helpful - I've had players donate rare building materials after seeing my constructions. If anyone wants to check out my builds or needs design advice, my in-game name is the same as here.</p>

                            <p>The combat system in this game is surprisingly deep for a browser-based title! Each weapon type has its own unique attack patterns, strengths, and weaknesses, which creates interesting strategic choices. I've found that the spear is actually the most versatile weapon - it has good range, decent damage, and the charge attack can break through shields if timed correctly. The armor system with different protection values against different damage types adds another layer of strategy - I switch between light armor for speed when scouting and heavy armor for raids. For those struggling with PvP, remember that timing is everything - learn to dodge-roll (double-tap direction keys) to avoid attacks rather than just trying to out-damage your opponent. Also, don't neglect consumables! The healing potions and buff foods can make a huge difference in extended fights. The clan warfare aspect is what keeps me coming back - our clan "Midnight Raiders" controls the northern territories, and the weekly battles against rival clans for resource-rich areas are intense and require real coordination. The developers deserve credit for creating a combat system that rewards skill and strategy rather than just grinding for the best gear (though that helps too!).</p>
