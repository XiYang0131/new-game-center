                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Hook Slice uses an intuitive three-click swing system that balances accessibility with skill-based gameplay. To begin your swing, click once to start the power meter. As the meter fills up, click a second time to set your shot power - the fuller the meter, the farther your ball will travel. The meter will then reverse direction, and you'll need to click a third time to determine accuracy. Clicking when the meter is centered results in a straight shot, while clicking too early or too late will cause your ball to hook (curve left) or slice (curve right) respectively. Before taking your swing, you can adjust several aspects of your shot. Use the left and right arrow keys to aim your shot direction, considering factors like wind and course layout. Select your club from the menu at the bottom of the screen - drivers and woods for distance, irons for accuracy, and wedges for approach shots. You can also adjust your stance using the stance selector, choosing between normal, punch (lower trajectory), or loft (higher trajectory) depending on the situation. Pay close attention to the wind indicator in the corner of the screen, as wind direction and strength significantly affect ball flight. The distance to the hole and elevation changes are displayed at the top of the screen to help you select the appropriate club and power. After each shot, the game automatically selects what it believes is the best club for your next shot, but you can change this based on your strategy. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock new courses and equipment that can help improve your performance. In career mode, managing your stamina between tournaments and investing in skill improvements becomes crucial for long-term success. Remember that practice makes perfect - take advantage of the practice range to get comfortable with the swing mechanics before tackling the more challenging courses.</p>

                            <p>As an avid golfer in real life, I'm impressed by how well Hook Slice captures the nuances of the sport! The three-click swing system strikes a perfect balance between accessibility and skill - it's easy to learn but takes genuine practice to master, just like real golf. I particularly appreciate how the different clubs actually behave distinctly from one another, with realistic distances and flight characteristics. The Pine Valley course is brilliantly designed with challenging dog-legs and strategically placed hazards that force you to think about each shot carefully. For beginners struggling with the game, my advice is to start with shorter clubs until you get comfortable with the timing mechanism - it's much easier to be accurate with a 7-iron than a driver! Also, don't underestimate the importance of reading the wind and elevation changes - they make a massive difference to where your ball ends up. The only feature I wish the game had is a putting preview line to help visualize breaks on the green, as reading putts can be quite challenging for newcomers. My personal best so far is 4-under on the Meadowbrook course, though I'm still working on mastering the more difficult Championship course with its narrow fairways and fast greens. Overall, this is easily the best browser-based golf game I've played!</p>

                            <p>I've never been much of a golf fan, but Hook Slice has completely changed my perspective on the sport! The game does an excellent job of easing new players in with its tutorial system that gradually introduces concepts like club selection, wind effects, and shot types. I started out terrible (my first round was something like 30 over par), but the learning curve feels rewarding rather than frustrating. After about a week of playing, I'm now consistently shooting close to par on the beginner courses. The career mode adds a nice progression element that keeps me coming back - upgrading my character's attributes and unlocking better equipment provides a satisfying sense of improvement. I've found that the sand wedge is incredibly versatile for beginners, as it's forgiving on timing and can get you out of most trouble spots. The sound design deserves special mention too - the satisfying "thwack" of a well-hit drive and the gentle ambient nature sounds create a surprisingly relaxing atmosphere. My only suggestion would be to add a multiplayer mode where you could challenge friends to a round. The mobile controls work surprisingly well too, making this a perfect game for quick sessions during breaks. If you're on the fence about trying a golf game, definitely give Hook Slice a chance - it might just convert you into a golf enthusiast like it did for me!</p>
