                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Use the mouse to aim and click to shoot your grappling hook. Hold the mouse button to swing and release to let go. You can also use the WASD or arrow keys to control your character's movement while swinging. Press the spacebar to jump. Timing is crucial - release your swing at the right moment to launch yourself in the desired direction and gain momentum. Collect power-ups throughout the levels to enhance your abilities temporarily. Some power-ups increase your swing speed, while others might give you extra strength against enemies or provide temporary invincibility. Defeat enemies by swinging into them or using special attacks that you unlock as you progress. Watch out for environmental hazards such as spikes, moving platforms, and falling objects. Each level has checkpoints - if you fail, you'll restart from the last checkpoint rather than the beginning of the level. Boss battles require specific strategies - look for patterns in their attacks and find the right moment to strike. Some areas can only be accessed by using advanced swinging techniques, such as chain swings or momentum-building. Experiment with different swinging angles and release points to find the optimal path through each level. As you progress, you'll unlock new abilities that enhance your swinging capabilities and combat prowess. Use these wisely to overcome increasingly challenging obstacles.</p>

                            <p>This game is incredibly fun and addictive! The swinging mechanics feel so satisfying when you get them right - there's nothing like perfectly timing a series of swings to fly through a difficult section. Level 7 with all the moving platforms was particularly challenging, but so rewarding when I finally beat it. The boss battle against the Giant Spider in the cave level is probably my favorite part - using the environment to your advantage is key there. For anyone struggling with the timing, I found that focusing on building momentum with smaller swings before attempting larger jumps really helps. Also, don't forget to upgrade your swing strength whenever possible - it makes a huge difference in the later levels. Can't wait to see if they add more levels in future updates!</p>

                            <p>I wasn't sure what to expect from a game with "Swing Monster" in the title, but I've been pleasantly surprised! The controls are intuitive enough that I could pick them up quickly, but there's definitely a skill ceiling that keeps me coming back to improve. The visual style is charming - I love the colorful environments and the character animations are full of personality. The difficulty progression feels just right - each level introduces new challenges without becoming frustrating. My only suggestion would be to add a practice mode where you could work on specific swinging techniques without the pressure of enemies. The power-up system adds a nice strategic element - saving the speed boost for particularly tricky sections has saved me many times. Overall, it's a great game that's easy to learn but challenging to master!</p>

                            <p>As a physics teacher, I'm impressed by how well this game models pendulum motion and momentum! The swinging mechanics feel realistic while still being fun and accessible. I've actually used examples from this game in my classroom to demonstrate concepts like conservation of energy and centripetal force. The level design is clever - it gradually introduces more complex swinging challenges that require you to apply different techniques. The ice level is particularly interesting from a physics perspective, as it changes how momentum works in the game. For players who are struggling with timing, remember that the length of your swing affects both your speed and the arc of your movement - shorter swings give you more control but less distance, while longer swings can launch you further but are harder to control precisely. I appreciate games that incorporate real physics in a way that's engaging rather than tedious, and Swing Monster definitely succeeds at that!</p>
