                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Use the arrow keys or WASD to move your character. Press the spacebar to jump. Press the Shift key to switch between heaven and hell realms. Each realm has different platforms, obstacles, and enemies. What exists in one realm might not exist in the other, so switching at the right moment is crucial for navigation. Pay attention to the visual cues that indicate which elements belong to which realm. Red-tinted objects typically exist in the hell realm, while blue-tinted objects exist in the heaven realm. Some platforms and obstacles exist in both realms but may behave differently. Enemies can only harm you if you're in the same realm as them. Use this to your advantage to avoid confrontations. Timing is essential - practice switching realms mid-jump to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Collect soul fragments throughout the levels to unlock new abilities and stages. Checkpoints are available throughout the levels, allowing you to restart from there if you fail. Some puzzles require quick realm switching in sequence - take your time to observe patterns before attempting difficult sections. The game gets progressively more challenging, introducing new mechanics and enemy types as you advance. If you get stuck, try experimenting with different approaches and realm-switching timings. Remember that what seems like an impossible jump in one realm might be easily achievable in the other.</p>

                            <p>This game is an absolute masterpiece of platforming design! The realm-switching mechanic adds such a unique dimension to the traditional platformer formula. Level 7 had me stuck for days until I realized you could switch realms during the boss's attack animation to make it vulnerable. The visual design is stunning - the contrast between the serene, ethereal heaven realm and the chaotic, fiery hell realm creates a perfect atmosphere for the gameplay. The difficulty curve is well-balanced, gradually introducing new mechanics without overwhelming the player. For anyone struggling with the Abyss section, try switching realms right as you reach the peak of your jump - this gives you just enough height to clear the larger gaps. Also, don't forget that some enemies can actually be used as platforms in the opposite realm! This portable edition runs smoothly even during the most chaotic sections, which is impressive. Can't wait to see what the developers come up with next!</p>

                            <p>I'm usually not a fan of super challenging platformers, but Two Sides of Hell has me completely hooked! The realm-switching mechanic is so intuitive once you get the hang of it, and it creates these amazing "aha!" moments when you figure out a particularly tricky section. The controls are responsive and precise, which is crucial for a game that demands such exact timing. I appreciate that the checkpoints are generous enough that I never felt frustrated even when dying repeatedly. The sound design deserves special mention - the way the music seamlessly transitions between realms adds so much to the immersion. The portable edition actually adds some quality-of-life improvements over the original, like the ability to see a ghost outline of platforms from the other realm, which helps with planning your moves. If you're new to the game, I recommend taking your time to explore each level thoroughly - there are hidden soul fragments that make later levels much more manageable once you unlock the abilities they provide.</p>

                            <p>From a game design perspective, Two Sides of Hell is brilliantly crafted. The core mechanic of realm-switching is simple to understand but offers incredible depth in how it's applied throughout the game. Each level introduces new ways to use this mechanic without explicitly tutorializing them - instead allowing players to discover solutions through experimentation. The visual language is consistent and clear, which is essential for a game where understanding which elements belong to which realm is crucial for success. The difficulty progression is exemplary, with each new challenge building upon previously established skills. I particularly appreciate how the game encourages players to master the timing of realm-switching through increasingly complex scenarios. The boss designs deserve special praise - each one requires you to observe patterns and use the realm-switching in creative ways rather than just testing reflexes. For those struggling with timing-sensitive sections, try counting rhythmically as you play - many of the more difficult sequences follow a musical pattern that can help you nail the timing. This portable edition maintains all the brilliance of the original while making it more accessible for on-the-go play.</p>
