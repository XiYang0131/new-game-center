                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>When you first start 3D Sandbox: Battle of the Kingdoms, you'll begin with a small settlement and limited resources. Use the WASD keys to move your camera around the map, and the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Right-click and drag to rotate your view. The game is divided into two main phases: kingdom building and battle. In the building phase, click on the construction menu (hammer icon) to access different building types. Start by constructing resource gatherers like lumber mills near forests and mines near mountains to secure a steady income of basic materials. As you gather resources, you can construct more advanced buildings such as barracks for training troops, workshops for creating siege weapons, and research facilities for unlocking new technologies. Design your kingdom's layout strategically, with defensive structures like walls and towers protecting your vital buildings. The population menu (person icon) allows you to assign villagers to different tasks, balancing resource gathering with military recruitment. In the military menu (sword icon), you can train various unit types and organize them into formations for battle. When you're ready for combat, you can either continue the campaign by attacking the next enemy kingdom or engage in a skirmish battle. During battle, select your units by clicking on them or dragging a selection box, then right-click to move them or attack enemy units. Use the special abilities of your units (accessible via the command bar at the bottom of the screen) at strategic moments to turn the tide of battle. Remember that terrain plays a significant role in combat - units on higher ground have advantages, while those crossing rivers or rough terrain move more slowly. After winning battles, you'll earn resources and possibly unlock new technologies or unit types to further develop your kingdom. The game autosaves regularly, but you can also manually save your progress through the menu (gear icon) in the top right corner.</p>

                            <p>3D Sandbox: Battle of the Kingdoms has completely consumed my free time for the past two weeks! The depth of the building system is impressive - I love how you can customize every aspect of your kingdom's layout and defenses. After several playthroughs, I've found that focusing on resource efficiency early game is crucial. My current strategy is to build a compact central fortress with resource gatherers protected by an outer wall, then expand with military outposts as I secure more territory. The battle system has a surprising amount of depth too - the terrain advantages are significant enough that I've won battles while outnumbered by carefully choosing the battlefield and using height advantages. For new players, I recommend prioritizing archer units early on, as they're versatile for both defense and offense. The Eagle Eye technology in the military research tree is also worth rushing, as it significantly increases archer range and effectiveness. The only minor issue I've encountered is that some of the larger battles can cause performance slowdowns, but reducing the graphics settings helps. Overall, this is one of the most engaging strategy games I've played in a browser!</p>

                            <p>As someone who loves both sandbox building games and RTS titles, this game is the perfect blend of both worlds! The freedom to design your kingdom exactly how you want is refreshing - I've experimented with everything from sprawling cities to compact fortress designs. What really sets this game apart is how your building decisions directly impact your military strategy. For example, I built a kingdom with multiple small outposts connected by walls, which allowed me to quickly reinforce different areas during attacks but made resource management more challenging. The variety of units keeps combat interesting, and I appreciate that there's no single "best" army composition - it really depends on your opponent and the terrain. The magical units unlocked later in the game add another layer of strategy, especially the dragon units that can fly over walls. If you're struggling with the campaign, try the skirmish mode with easier AI to practice different strategies. My one suggestion for improvement would be adding more variety to the biomes and environments. Despite that minor criticism, I've already sunk countless hours into this game and keep coming back to try new kingdom designs and battle tactics!</p>
