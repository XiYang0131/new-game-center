                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Command Strike FPS uses standard first-person shooter controls that will be familiar to most players, while offering depth for those who want to master the game's tactical elements. On desktop, use the WASD keys to move your character, with W for forward, S for backward, A to strafe left, and D to strafe right. The mouse controls your aim, with left-click to fire your weapon and right-click to aim down sights for improved accuracy. The Shift key allows you to sprint, while Ctrl or C lets you crouch for improved accuracy and smaller hitbox. The spacebar is used for jumping, which can be combined with movement keys to reach elevated positions or avoid enemy fire. Pressing E interacts with objectives, picks up weapons, or uses special abilities depending on your character class. The R key reloads your weapon, and it's crucial to find safe moments to reload rather than being caught with an empty magazine during an engagement. The number keys (1-5) switch between your primary weapon, secondary weapon, knife, and utility items. The game begins with a brief tutorial that covers basic movement, shooting mechanics, and game objectives. After completing the tutorial, you can jump into matches against AI bots to practice before facing human opponents. When joining a match, you'll first select your character class, each with different strengths: Assault classes excel at frontline combat with balanced weapons and abilities. Support classes provide utility and area control with specialized equipment. Recon classes focus on gathering information and flanking enemies. Heavy classes offer superior firepower and durability but reduced mobility. After selecting your class, you'll choose your loadout from available weapons and equipment. Primary weapons include assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, and sniper rifles, while secondary weapons are typically pistols. Utility items vary by class but may include flashbangs, smoke grenades, or healing items. The game features several modes, each with different objectives: Team Deathmatch focuses purely on eliminating enemy players to reach a target score. Bomb Defusal has one team planting a bomb at designated sites while the other team defends and attempts to defuse it if planted. Territory Control requires teams to capture and hold strategic points on the map to accumulate points. Communication is essential for success in Command Strike FPS. The game includes a ping system (activated by pressing Q and selecting options from a wheel) that allows you to mark enemy positions, suggest movement paths, or highlight objectives. Voice chat is also available by pressing and holding V, enabling more detailed coordination with teammates. For beginners, focus first on mastering basic movement and aim before worrying about advanced tactics. The shooting range mode is excellent for practicing recoil control and getting comfortable with different weapons. Pay attention to the minimap in the corner of your screen, which shows teammate positions and spotted enemies. Learning map layouts is crucial - knowing common sniper positions, choke points, and flanking routes will give you a significant advantage. Economy management is important in some game modes, where performance in previous rounds determines your available funds for weapons and equipment in subsequent rounds. Save money when necessary to ensure your team can make full purchases in critical rounds. Remember that teamwork is the key to victory in Command Strike FPS. Even the most skilled individual players will struggle against a coordinated team that communicates effectively and uses complementary abilities. Play the objective rather than focusing solely on eliminations, and be willing to adapt your playstyle based on what your team needs.</p>

                            <p>After playing competitive FPS games for over a decade, I can confidently say that Command Strike hits a sweet spot between accessibility and depth that many other titles miss. The gunplay feels satisfying with just the right amount of recoil to master - not so easy that it feels arcade-like, but not so punishing that new players can't enjoy it. What really sets this game apart is the class system and how it encourages teamwork without forcing rigid meta compositions. I've found success with various team setups as long as everyone communicates and plays their role effectively. The map design deserves special praise too. Each location has multiple viable strategies for both attacking and defending, with clever sightlines and just enough verticality to keep things interesting without becoming frustrating. The "Canal" map is particularly well-balanced with its mix of long corridors and tight corners that cater to different weapon types. For new players struggling with recoil control, I recommend starting with the M4A1 or MP5 - both have manageable patterns that are forgiving while you learn the fundamentals. Spend at least 10 minutes in the shooting range before each session to warm up your aim. The economy system adds another layer of strategy that I appreciate. Deciding when to save, when to force buy, and when to make a full investment requires team coordination and game sense that develops over time. I've won many rounds with just pistols because we communicated effectively and caught the enemy team off guard. The sound design is also top-notch and crucial for success - I can consistently pinpoint enemy positions based on footsteps and reload sounds, which adds a tactical element that rewards careful listening and patience. If I had one criticism, it would be that some of the utility grenades could use better visual indicators for their area of effect, especially for newer players. Overall though, Command Strike FPS has become my go-to competitive shooter, striking that perfect balance between casual fun and competitive depth.</p>

                            <p>As someone who typically avoids competitive shooters due to their steep learning curves and sometimes toxic communities, I was pleasantly surprised by how welcoming Command Strike FPS feels for newcomers. The tutorial system is comprehensive without being overwhelming, and the bot matches provide a perfect environment to practice before jumping into real games. What I appreciate most is the ping system that allows effective communication without needing a microphone - perfect for players like me who aren't always comfortable with voice chat. The character class system has been a game-changer for me. I struggled with precision aiming at first, but found I could still contribute meaningfully to my team by playing Support and focusing on utility. Dropping ammo packs, throwing smoke grenades to cover advances, and using the healing station to keep teammates in the fight made me feel valuable even when my kill count wasn't impressive. The matchmaking system deserves credit too - after my initial placement matches, I've consistently been matched with players of similar skill level, leading to close, exciting games rather than one-sided stomps. The progression system keeps me coming back, with meaningful unlocks that expand gameplay options without creating pay-to-win scenarios. I've been playing for about three weeks now and have already unlocked several primary weapons and a few character skins just through regular play. The different game modes offer nice variety when I want to change things up. Team Deathmatch is great for quick sessions, while Bomb Defusal provides those tense, memorable moments when you're the last player alive trying to defuse with seconds remaining on the clock. For other beginners, I recommend starting with the Territory Control mode, as it provides clear objectives and predictable enemy movements that help you learn the maps. The respawn system in this mode also means less time waiting and more time practicing. The community has been surprisingly helpful too - several experienced players have offered tips and encouragement rather than the criticism I expected. Overall, Command Strike FPS has changed my perception of competitive shooters by providing an experience that's accessible to newcomers while still offering depth for those who want to improve.</p>
