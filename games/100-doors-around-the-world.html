                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Tap or click on objects in the environment to interact with them. Drag items to move them or combine them with other objects. Pay close attention to details in each scene - colors, numbers, patterns, and positions often contain important clues. Some puzzles require you to shake, tilt, or rotate your device (or use keyboard controls on desktop). Look for hidden objects by exploring every part of the screen. If you get stuck, the hint system can provide guidance, but try to solve puzzles on your own first for the most satisfying experience. Each door has a unique solution, and once you figure it out, you'll unlock the door and proceed to the next level. The puzzles become progressively more difficult, introducing new mechanics and requiring more complex solutions. Remember that some puzzles may require multiple steps to solve, and the solution might not always be obvious at first glance. Think outside the box and experiment with different approaches when you're stuck.</p>

                            <p>This is one of the best room escape-style puzzle games I've played! The global theme adds a nice touch, with each location having puzzles that incorporate elements of that country's culture. I particularly loved the Paris levels with the Eiffel Tower mechanics. The difficulty curve is well-balanced - it starts simple but gradually introduces more complex puzzles that really make you think. Level 37 in Egypt had me stumped for days until I realized the hieroglyphics were actually a mathematical equation! For those struggling with the Tokyo level, pay close attention to the colors of the cherry blossoms - they're not random.</p>

                            <p>I love how this game makes you think in different ways for each puzzle. Some require logical thinking, others test your observation skills, and some need you to think creatively outside the box. The hint system is well-designed - it gives you just enough guidance without spoiling the solution. I've been playing with my 12-year-old daughter, and it's become our evening ritual to solve one or two doors together. It's educational too - she's learning about different countries and landmarks while exercising her problem-solving skills. The New York level with the subway map puzzle was our favorite so far!</p>

                            <p>As someone who's played many escape room games, I appreciate the variety and creativity in these puzzles. Each door feels unique, and I never got the sense that puzzles were being recycled or repeated. The difficulty is just right - challenging enough to be satisfying when you solve a puzzle, but not so difficult that it becomes frustrating. I did have to use hints for a few of the later levels, especially the one in Rio that involved music notes (I'm not musically inclined). The save system works perfectly, allowing me to pick up where I left off. I've completed all 100 doors and honestly wish there were more! Looking forward to a sequel with new locations.</p>
