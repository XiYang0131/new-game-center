                <h2>Game Description</h2>
                <p>Tenkyu Ball is an engaging physics-based puzzle game that challenges your spatial awareness and dexterity. In this addictive game, you control a small ball by tilting and rotating intricate 3D mazes, using gravity to guide it through obstacles and reach the goal. Each level presents a unique labyrinth with increasing complexity, featuring moving platforms, narrow pathways, deadly traps, and clever mechanisms that must be navigated with precision. The game's realistic physics engine creates a satisfying sense of weight and momentum as you carefully maneuver the ball through each challenge. With its minimalist aesthetic, intuitive controls, and progressively difficult levels, Tenkyu Ball offers a perfect balance of accessibility and challenge that will keep you coming back to master each maze.</p>
                
                <p>Game Features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Over 100 meticulously designed 3D maze levels with increasing difficulty</li>
                    <li>Realistic physics that create authentic ball movement and momentum</li>
                    <li>Various obstacles including moving platforms, narrow bridges, and gravity-altering zones</li>
                    <li>Intuitive controls that allow precise manipulation of the maze</li>
                    <li>Minimalist visual design with clean aesthetics and smooth animations</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>How to Play</h3>
                    <p>Tenkyu Ball features simple controls that are easy to learn but require practice to master. Use your mouse or touchpad to tilt the maze in different directions - click and drag to rotate the maze, causing the ball to roll according to gravity. The objective in each level is to guide the ball from its starting position to the goal (usually marked by a glowing platform or hole) without falling off the edges of the maze. The game uses realistic physics, so you'll need to be mindful of the ball's momentum. Moving too quickly can cause the ball to fly off the edge, while moving too slowly might not give you enough momentum to overcome certain obstacles. As you progress through the levels, you'll encounter various challenges: narrow pathways that require precise control, moving platforms that must be timed correctly, switches that activate bridges or remove barriers, teleporters that transport the ball to different parts of the maze, and special surfaces like ice (which reduces friction) or sticky areas (which slows the ball down). Some levels have time limits or move counters, adding an extra layer of challenge. If the ball falls off the maze, you'll need to restart the level. The game saves your progress automatically, so you can return to the highest level you've reached. For particularly challenging levels, try to break down the maze into sections and tackle each part separately. Observe the layout before moving the ball, planning your route in advance. Remember that controlling speed is often more important than moving quickly - sometimes you need to slow down and make small, precise adjustments rather than large movements. With practice, you'll develop better spatial awareness and control, allowing you to tackle even the most complex mazes with confidence.</p>

                            <p>Tenkyu Ball has completely taken over my free time! The physics in this game feel so satisfying - there's something incredibly rewarding about perfectly navigating a tricky section after multiple attempts. I'm currently stuck on level 47 (the one with the alternating moving platforms and the narrow spiral at the end), but I'm determined to beat it. For anyone struggling with the early levels, my advice is to focus on making small, controlled movements rather than large tilts. The momentum of the ball is your biggest challenge and ally. I've found that using a mouse gives me much better precision than a touchpad, especially for the later levels that require subtle adjustments. The difficulty curve is really well designed - each new mechanic is introduced gradually before being combined with previous ones in increasingly complex ways. My favorite levels are definitely the ones with the gravity-shifting zones that let you roll on the ceiling - they really make you think differently about how to approach the maze. The only minor criticism I have is that some of the ice levels can feel a bit too slippery and frustrating, but the satisfaction of finally completing them makes up for it. Overall, this is one of the most addictive puzzle games I've played in years!</p>

                            <p>This game perfectly captures what makes physics-based puzzles so engaging - simple concept, intuitive controls, but endless depth in terms of challenge. I appreciate how the visual design is clean and minimalist, allowing you to focus entirely on the maze without distractions. The sound design deserves special mention too - the subtle rolling sounds and satisfying "plunk" when you reach the goal add so much to the experience. I've completed all 100 levels (took me about two weeks of dedicated playing), and I can say that the later levels are genuinely challenging without ever feeling unfair. Level 83 with its combination of teleporters and moving platforms was particularly memorable - it took me at least 30 attempts to get the timing right! For new players, don't get discouraged if you get stuck on a level. Sometimes stepping away and coming back with fresh eyes makes all the difference. Also, for the levels with multiple sections, try to mentally break them down into smaller challenges rather than seeing the whole maze as one obstacle. My one suggestion for improvement would be adding a level editor so players could create and share their own mazes. That would add so much replay value to an already excellent game. If you enjoy spatial puzzles or have any fondness for those old wooden labyrinth toys, you'll absolutely love Tenkyu Ball!</p>
